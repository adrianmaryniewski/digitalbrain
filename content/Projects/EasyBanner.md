## What is EasyBanner?

EasyBanner is my microservice to generate jpg / png / pdf files based on HTML / CSS code.

I use it in conjunction with [[Optimization/Tools/MakeHQ]] to create [[Optimization/Automation/Automation]].

Currently, most of the graphics I post on social media are created from templates and generated with the help of [[Projects/EasyBanner]].

## [[Optimization/Tools/MakeHQ]]
EasyBanner has its own module in MakeHQ, currently available only to those with purchased access.
