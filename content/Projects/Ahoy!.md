## What is Ahoy?
Ahoy! is a community we always wanted to be a part of. As a result of not finding such a place, we decided to create one ourselves. 

Actual focus on a cutting edge topics in areas like UX&UI, Photography, Graphic Design, [[Optimization/Automation/Automation]] and [[Web Development]]. In practice, this is a place for Tech Outliers who want to meet like minded people. 

The community is based on the Circle.so platform and a number of our plug-ins and products (e.g. [[Projects/EasyCart]]).
