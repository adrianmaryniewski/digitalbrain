overment is a YouTube channel dedicated to programmers. The whole project is based on the most important principle for me which is [[Respect for Time]] both mine and others.

## Principles of making a videos
- I respect the time of the recipients of [[Respect for Time]]
	- I'm doing some solid research
	- I cut out unnecessary elements
- I speak in simple words about difficult things
- I hide unnecessary interface elements
- I make videos on topics that I myself want to know better or consolidate

## Tools
- I use [[Workflowy]] to create scenarios and more recently [[Optimization/Tools/Obsidian]].
- I use [[Optimization/Tools/Screenflow]] for recordings
- I collect information about movies in [[Optimization/Tools/Airtable]].
- I publish and promote videos automatically [[Projects/zautomatyzowani#YouTube na Autopilocie]]

## YouTube
- [[Knowledge/Programming/JavaScript/JavaScript]]
- [[Knowledge/Programming/REST/REST]]
- [[Knowledge/Programming/Node.js]]
- [[Knowledge/Programming/git/git]]
