[[Projects/eduweb]] is a project that I have been involved in since April 2020. It has a special meaning for me, because it was on eduweb that I started to seriously learn programming.

## Courses

### Warsztat: Laravel Livewire
I personally use [[Laravel]] in several projects I develop. Livewire is a [[Knowledge/Programming/JavaScript/JavaScript]] framework that allows you to create highly interactive applications without using front-end frameworks.

In my opinion, it is rather a curiosity that can be used in a very narrow group of projects. Especially useful for [[Rapid Development]].
