Here, I share everything I know. I created this place primarily for myself, so I can easily return to all the materials posted here. At the same time, I thought you might find it all equally valuable to you. Please keep in mind, that this project won't be finished and what's more important, many things will change over time. What is true for me today, probably tomorrow won't be.

* [[Knowledge/Mental models/Mental models]] I consciously use
* Notes from the [[Knowledge/Books/Books]] I've read

## Concept

This entire project is based on the concept of the so-called [digital garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden). In my case, I've been testing a combination of Notion and Super.so and Github integration with GitBook. For a while I used the Obsidian Publish function and currently I generate the whole thing in Hugo based on the Quartz project [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/)
