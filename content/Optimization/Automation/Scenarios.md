## Publishing posts on Social Media
I publish most of the posts with the help of [[Optimization/Tools/Buffer]] to which the data goes automatically from [[Optimization/Tools/Airtable]] thanks to [[Optimization/Tools/MakeHQ]]. I also have [[Optimization/Tools/Keyboard Maestro]] automations that allow me to send data to these services directly from my computer, without having to open a browser.

## Newsletter automation
I use [[Optimization/Tools/Sendgrid]], [[Mailchimp]] or [[GetResponse]] to send the newsletter depending on the project. The process of assembling the template and sending happens fully automatically thanks to [[Optimization/Tools/MakeHQ]].

I show the entire newletter automation process in the Automation package:[[Projects/zautomatyzowani#Newsletter na Autopilocie]]

## YouTube automation
I gather all the information about the videos I publish in [[Optimization/Tools/Airtable]]. From there, with the help of [[Optimization/Tools/Zapier]] and [[Optimization/Tools/MakeHQ]], they are automatically uploaded to my YouTube channel.

I show the entire YouTube automation process in the Automation packet[[Projects/zautomatyzowani#YouTube na Autopilocie]]

## Podcast automation
The podcast [[Projects/zautomatyzowani]] is run almost entirely 'on Autopilot'. Episode information is collected in [[Optimization/Tools/Airtable]] and then automatically published with the help of [[Optimization/Tools/MakeHQ]] and [[Optimization/Tools/Zapier]] via the [[Spreaker]] service to all podcast platforms and YouTube.

## Automating the sales process
I sell all products with the help of [[Projects/EasyCart]] and the post-purchase process is entirely handled by [[Optimization/Tools/MakeHQ]] scenarios.

## Generating graphics
I generate graphics based on Webflow templates with the help of my own [[Projects/EasyBanner]] microservice. Most of the time, I combine them through scripts in [[Optimization/Tools/MakeHQ]].

## Automatic file organization
I connect local files to the cloud with the help of [[Optimization/Tools/Hazel]]. Defined rules help me stay organized and perform actions on local files, which can also be logged by scenarios in [[Optimization/Tools/MakeHQ]]

## Text Expander
Currently, I use [[Optimization/Tools/Raycast]] or [[Optimization/Tools/Keyboard Maestro]] as Text Expander, depending on the type of extension. Especially since, in addition to completed templates, I use the expander to run, for example, web pages (recently opened project in Figma or Webflow) or perform operations on files (move to desktop).
