## [[Optimization/Tools/MakeHQ]] 
MakeHQ (formerly Integromat) is the best platform I know for easily connecting services through [[Knowledge/Programming/API]]. Its most important features are webhooks, an http module that allows you to connect to any application, and a great API that I use for my own extensions.

## [[Optimization/Tools/Raycast]]
Raycast is currently the #1 app in my ranking. The brilliant API and interface make it extremely fun to create automations. Additionally, with the help of [[Knowledge/Programming/JavaScript/JavaScript]], [[TypeScript]] and [[Knowledge/Programming/Node.js]] you can easily create your own extensions.

## [[Optimization/Tools/Zapier]]
I use Zapier at times when MakeHQ can't handle it (e.g. for Lead Score by Zapier or transferring large files).

## [[Optimization/Tools/Airtable]]
Airtable to nothing more than a database that exposes an API by default. In addition to collecting data and combining it with the help of [[Optimization/Tools/MakeHQ]], I also use [[Knowledge/Programming/JavaScript/JavaScript]] to create automation directly in [[Optimization/Tools/Airtable]]

## [[Optimization/Tools/Keyboard Maestro]]
Keyboard Maestro is a brilliant application with the help of which I automate almost everything on my system. It integrates great with [[Optimization/Tools/Raycast]], [[Optimization/Tools/Alfred]] and [[Optimization/Tools/Better Touch Tool]]. In addition, I often execute JavaScript code, bash scripts and AppleScript with its help.

Using KM together with Matthew Wierzbicki, we created [[Projects/Design Maestro]].
