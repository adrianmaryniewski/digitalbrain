# Context
MacBook is the most important work tool for me. For years I worked on Windows but since I bought my first MacBook, I can't imagine going back.

I use it not only for programming but also for graphic design and video recording and editing.

At every step, I use the maximum potential (e.g., with the help of [[Optimization/Tools/Keyboard Maestro]] or [[Optimization/Tools/Raycast]]) and reach for the best equipment currently available to me.

## Specifications

> ⚠️ IMPORTANT: The following specification lists the equipment I currently own. Over the years, I have developed my projects using tools that I simply could not afford at the time. I only made sure to update my setup as much as possible to give me the most comfort while still being within my capabilities.

## Computer
- MacBook Pro 2021 14"
- Procesor M1 Max - 10 rdzeni CPU / 32 GPU / 16 NE
- 64 GB RAM
- 2 TB SSD

Most of the time I work in desktop mode with a monitor [Apple Pro Display XDR](https://www.apple.com/pl/pro-display-xdr/) and Keychron K3 v2 Slim keyboard and Trackpad (Magic Trackpad) connected.

## Video equipment and lighting
I record video with the help of Sony ZV-1 camcorder (with [dummy battery](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07DMXX9W6/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1)) And a Razer Seiren microphone with a Rode PSA-1 handle. I capture the image with the help of [[Optimization/Tools/Screenflow]] And I edit in [[FinalCut Pro]]. I use lighting in the form of [[YN-900]](https://yongnuo.com.pl/?p=463) lights.

> I bought a Razer Seiren microphone right at the beginning of the development of my YouTube channel. Taking care of high quality audio is key, although nowadays you can get much cheaper equipment that offers more capabilities.

To reduce reverberation during recordings, I use acoustic panels from [Addictive Sound](https://addictivesound.pl/), which I highly recommend.

## Desk and chair
The desk, which supports the option of standing work, is from the company [Deskwise](https://deskwise.pl/), but because I received it as a gift, I do not have information on the model (it was not indicated anywhere).

In sitting mode, I use the [Herman Miller Embody Balance] chair(https://sklep.k-r.pl/pl/p/Herman-Miller-Embody-Balance-C7/12)
