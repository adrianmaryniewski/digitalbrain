The iPad is, in my opinion, one of the best pieces of electronic music I have ever encountered.

## Applications
- [[Optimization/Tools/Kindle]] - if I have a tablet with me, I read on it
- [[Optimization/Tools/Notability]] - I keep a [[Foundations/ðŸ““ Journal]] almost every day just on the iPad using the Apple Pencil
- [[Optimization/Tools/Procreate]] - in my spare time and on trips I draw

In addition, I have virtually no applications installed on the iPad other than those mentioned above. For me, it is a device intended solely for creative work and reading. This state has remained unchanged since I bought it.

Keeping the number of applications small allows me to maintain my focus while doing creative work.

## External keyboard
I have used it more than a dozen times. Most of the time I prefer to write on [[Optimization/Hardware/Macbook]]instead of an iPad. In my opinion, the iPad is not yet good enough to meaningfully replace the computer, although the situation is changing quite rapidly. Currently, it complements the workflow of working with a computer very well (especially in [[Optimization/Tools/Procreate]] and [[Optimization/Tools/Figma]]).

## Specyfikacja
iPad Pro 2017 9.7'' 512GB with Apple Pencil gen 1 and Smart Keyboard. In addition, the display is protected by the [PaperLike](https://paperlike.com/) overlay, which makes writing on the iPad with Apple Pencil and reading books much more enjoyable.

## Color filtering mode
As on [[Optimization/Hardware/iPhone]], I have the color filtering mode (black and white) turned on practically all the time. The reason for this is that limiting the number of colors reduces the desire to reach for the iPad unnecessarily.

I turn on color mode only when I need it (e.g., when drawing), and I do it through a configured shortcut of pressing the Home button three times.
