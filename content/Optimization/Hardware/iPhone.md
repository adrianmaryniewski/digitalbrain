For the past few years, my main phone has been an iPhone and I find it hard to imagine going back to Android or alternatives.

## Aplikacje
- [[Optimization/Tools/Kindle]] - I read at every spare moment
- [[Optimization/Tools/Audible]] - if my hands are busy or, for example, I'm driving a car, listening to audio books
- [[Spotify]] - when I don't have the opportunity to read at the moment, I listen to music
- [[Goodreads]] - this is where I record all the information about the books I read
- [[Optimization/Tools/Endel.io]] - I listen interchangeably with Spotify and almost always when doing creative work
- [[Optimization/Tools/Anki]] - I rework the proposed decks of cards every day
- [[Optimization/Tools/Superhuman]] - I use as a mail client
- [[Optimization/Tools/Headspace]] - Application for [[Mindfulness]]
- [[Optimization/Tools/Waking Up]] - Application for [[Mindfulness]] - I use interchangeably with [[Optimization/Tools/Headspace]]
- [[Optimization/Tools/Reveri]] - recommended by [[Knowledge/People/Andrew Huberman]] self-hypnosis application

In addition, I have gas station payment apps installed on my phone (I have [[Optimization/Automation/Automation]] sending selected fuel invoices directly to accounting) and food ordering apps.

For the vast majority of the time, my phone is in black and white mode according to the instructions from the [Szary Ekran](https://szaryekran.pl)
