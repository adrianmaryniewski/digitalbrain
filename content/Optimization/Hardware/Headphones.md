For me, headphones are an essential part of good [[Knowledge/Thoughts/Focus]], especially in combination with [[Optimization/Tools/Endel.io]], [[Optimization/Tools/Session]] and ANC (Active Noise Cancelling) technology.

I own Airpods Pro and Airpods Max headphones. I use the former away from home, the latter practically whenever I'm at my computer.

## ANC
The ability to mute the surroundings is the most important feature for me in terms of both [[Knowledge/Thoughts/Focus]] and [[Knowledge/Thoughts/Relax]]s. In the case of the Airpods Max, this performs amazingly well, although I know that in headphones from a similar shelf of other manufacturers, they offer similar results.
