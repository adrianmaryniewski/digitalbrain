## What is StreamDeck?
Elgato StreamDeck is a kind of auxiliary keyboard, on the keys of which you can display any graphics, including dynamic ones (automatic replacement of photo and description).

In addition, the keys can change depending on the context (e.g., an open program) and act as folders inside which we have additional buttons.

It is designed for streamers but is also great for professional programs that require access to multiple options and, of course, [[Optimization/Automation/Automation]].

## How do I use StreamDeck?
As of July 2021, I am using [Elgato StreamDeck](https://www.elgato.com/en/stream-deck) as an additional keyboard, used for automation and easy control of macros defined in [[Optimization/Tools/Keyboard Maestro]]

I have StreamDeck version XL and additionally use the ability to define folders.

**Mostly with its help I launch the:**
- launching groups of notes in [[Optimization/Tools/Obsidian]] / [[Optimization/Tools/Notion]]
- launching databases from [[Optimization/Tools/Airtable]]
- running the web pages I open frequently (and not only)
- music control, including throughout the house
- switching contexts between projects (workflow automation)

## Automations
I enjoy discovering new ways to use StreamDeck. Seemingly, it is just an unusual keyboard and in practice it offers very great possibilities.

### Modes of operation
When working, it takes the most time and energy to change the context. I've set up buttons on the main screen linked to activities I want to do regularly. By linking actions to [[Optimization/Tools/Keyboard Maestro]], I can switch between projects and tasks with a single button.

**Examples:** 
- Activate email reply mode (loose music, no DND and activation of Superhuman and browser)
- The projects I am involved in are folders inside of which there are actions related to them (such as writing articles for the easycart blog or creating podcast scripts for automated)
- switching between operating modes (focused / loose)
- signaling that recording is on

### Activating bots
I categorize my [[Optimization/Automation/Automation]] by bot avatars that perform specific tasks for me. Their scenarios are designed in such a way that they can be combined with each other or called separately.

### Additional observations
Stream Deck works best in conjunction with [[Optimization/Tools/Keyboard Maestro]], as this allows us to assign any macro to a button.

At the same time, this makes setting up a Stream Deck technically and conceptually challenging, as preparing actually useful macros is not obvious.

The most important benefit of SD is that you can use it to activate various system functions faster. The downside is that not having access to it (e.g., on a trip with a laptop) disrupts your entire workflow. As a result, I use [[Optimization/Tools/Raycast]] or [[Projects/Design Maestro]] more and more often than Stream Deck.
