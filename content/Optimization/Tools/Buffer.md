## What is a Buffer?
[[Optimization/Tools/Buffer]] is a service with the help of which I publish almost all posts in all social channels. It connects great with [[Optimization/Tools/Airtable]] and [[Optimization/Tools/MakeHQ]].

## How do I use Buffer?
With the help of [[Optimization/Tools/MakeHQ]], I send information to it, which I save in [[Optimization/Tools/Airtable]] beforehand.

I don't happen to log into it, and I'm increasingly posting directly to social media, since I store the schedule in [[Optimization/Tools/Notion]] or [[Optimization/Tools/Airtable]] anyway.
