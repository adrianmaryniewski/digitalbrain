# What is Audible?
This is an app with Audiobooks, directly from Amazon. In my opinion, it is the best book listening app that exists on the market.

## How do I use Audible?
In [[Optimization/Tools/Audible]], I listen to all audiobooks. From the beginning, I reach for original English-language titles to learn English while reading. Very often, while listening to books, I also browse e-books on [[Optimization/Tools/Kindle]] and save selected fractions of books as [[Optimization/Tools/Anki]] cards 

After I finish listening to a book, I always save it on my [[Goodreads]] profile.
