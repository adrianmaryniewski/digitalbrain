title: Figma
---

This is currently one of the best interface design applications (if not the best).

## How do I use Figma?
I usually use design systems, such as [[Systemflow]]. Besides, I design all graphic templates in it, which I then map in [[Optimization/Tools/Webflow]] and generate with the help of [[Projects/EasyBanner]].
