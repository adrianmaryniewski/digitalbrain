# What is Alfred?

[Optimization/Tools/Alfred]] is an overlay (or alternative) for Spotlight. With a paid extension (PowerPack), it allows you to connect to, for example, [[Optimization/Tools/Keyboard Maestro]] or [[Spotify]].

Alfred's biggest advantages are its speed and plugins, which can be developed independently using [[Knowledge/Programming/JavaScript/JavaScript]] and [[Knowledge/Programming/Node.js]].

> ℹ️ For Windows users, there is an alternative in the form of Wox Launcher. However, I have not had the opportunity to use it.
> 
> ⚠️ Currently, I use Alfred exclusively to quickly transfer files with the help of actions . The other functions have been completely replaced by [[Optimization/Tools/Raycast]] for me.

## How do I use Alfred?

- The File Search option allows you to open files and directories very quickly. All you need to do in the Alfred window is to start the search from the character `'`:  ![](https://space.overment.com/Screen-Shot-2021-11-19-22-22-50/Screen-Shot-2021-11-19-22-22-50.png)
- The option allows you to perform actions on files (and more) very quickly. I mainly use it to quickly move files between folders: ![](https://space.overment.com/Screen-Shot-2021-11-19-22-23-46/Screen-Shot-2021-11-19-22-23-46.png)

**I also use extensions.
- [[Spotify]] Mini Player - easy control of music
- Alfred Maestro - integration with [[Optimization/Tools/Keyboard Maestro]]
- Google Suggest - Google search directly in Alfred
- Menu Bar Search - **genius** extension that allows you to launch any action from the menu of the active program. It is ideal for applications that do not give you the ability to fully configure keyboard shortcuts
- Password Generator - a great solution for quick password generation. Works great in combination with [[Optimization/Tools/1Password]]
- Tailwind CSS Doc - [[Tailwind CSS]] documentation search engine.
- Dash - documentation for more than 200 technologies. I use about 10
