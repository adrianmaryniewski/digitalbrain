title: Headspace
---

It's an app for Mindfulness, breathing exercises and calming. I use it practically every day. Particularly noteworthy here is a quote by [[Knowledge/People/Ray Dalio]], according to whom transcendental meditation is one of the main reasons behind his success.

## How do I use Headspace?
I relax 1-3 times a day with headphones and one of the available scenarios or sounds (such as soundscape). Usually one session lasts from 10-30 minutes.
