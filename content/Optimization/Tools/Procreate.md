This is an application for [[Optimization/Hardware/iPad]] in which I draw as a hobby and create elements for videos for [[Projects/overment]] or [[Projects/eduweb]].

The fun part about this app is that you can connect your iPad with [[Macbook]] (sharing clipboard) so you can copy / paste almost anything between those devices. It's fun and useful.

One of my first drawings:
