# What is Airtable?
It's a data storage application that resembles an Excel spreadsheet. Its biggest advantage is that it is built according to the [[Knowledge/Programming/API]] first approach, which works well in the context of [[Optimization/Automation/Automation]]

I store virtually all of my published content in [[Optimization/Tools/Airtable]] and use it as a database. An example database for one of my projects:

**The big advantage here is:**.
- instant access to [[Knowledge/Programming/API]] integrations with [[Optimization/Tools/MakeHQ]] / [[Optimization/Tools/Zapier]]
- Optimization/Automation/Automation]] tab to run custom [[Knowledge/Programming/JavaScript/JavaScript]] scripts - this is great to connect with [webhook]s and [[Optimization/Tools/MakeHQ]]
- I use the forms view very often to quickly add information (e.g., completing data on an episode of a new podcast) or when working with, for example, an editor who, instead of receiving access to the full database, fills out a short form with onzach which material he has prepared

There are several alternatives to Airtable, but other than [[Google Sheets]], none of them perform comparably well.
