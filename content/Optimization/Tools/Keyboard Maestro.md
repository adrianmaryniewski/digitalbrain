title: Keyboard Maestro
---

[[Optimization/Tools/Keyboard Maestro]] is an application I use to automate many tasks within the OSX operating system. I use it together with [[Raycast]] and [[Better Touch Tool]]. I regularly find myself using [[Knowledge/Programming/JavaScript/JavaScript]], [[ActionScript]] and [[Knowledge/Programming/Node.js]] scripts to create individual actions.

[[Design Maestro]] is a project created by me and Matt Wierzbicki. It's a plug & play package of Keyboard Maestro macros with a dedicated UI created in [[Svelte]].

## My macros
As of today I have ~400 macros which are highly coupled with [[Automation]] scenarios and tools like [[MakeHQ]] and [[Shortcuts]].
