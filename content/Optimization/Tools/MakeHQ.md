[Make](https://make.com/) is the most important automation tool I use. With it, I connect all services that have [[Knowledge/Programming/API]] using either built-in modules or connecting directly through [[Knowledge/Programming/API]] via the HTTP module.

In some cases, I create my own [[Optimization/Automation/Microservices]] to perform tasks that:
- are not feasible with off-the-shelf tools
- expand the capabilities of existing tools

Almost all of the scenarios uses Webhooks in order to run immediately from [[Optimization/Tools/Keyboard Maestro]] or any [[Optimization/Tools/Airtable]] script or automation.

An examples of scenarios are described here ðŸ‘‰ [[Automation]] and there ðŸ‘‰ [[Microservices]]. I have a couple of modules for Make, which I've created by myself: [[EasyBanner]], [[EasyTimer]] or EasyCoin system for handling $AHOY in the [[Ahoy!]] community. 

This is an example - I've created a couple of extensions for [[Circle.so]] which are connected with [[Airtable]] and Make and allows us to even connect with the OpenSea to get informations about [[NFT]] holded by a given user.
