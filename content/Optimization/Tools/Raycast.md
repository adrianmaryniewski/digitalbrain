Raycast is a launcher that has almost entirely replaced [[Optimization/Tools/Alfred]] and largely replaces [[Optimization/Tools/Keyboard Maestro]].

**The most important things about Raycast:**
- overall UX & Performance
- beautiful UI
- an ingenious API for creating extensions in JS / TS / Node.js and the use of AppleScript and Bash
