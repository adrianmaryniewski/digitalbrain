## What is IntelliJ?
It's an IDE created by JetBrains that, in my opinion, is the best tool for developers, and I find it hard to explain why so many people still use Visual Studio Code. In one sentence, the difference between the two can be described as 'IntelliJ just 'understands' your code'.

Why IntelliJ if I don't program in Java? Because of all the JetBrains IDEs, it is the most powerful. As a result, only in some cases I need to install some plug-ins for it. As a full-stack developer, working in parallel in multiple technologies, it is very convenient for me. Unlike WebStorm, IntellIJ works perfectly for me, regardless of the project.

## What plugins do I use?
The list is not long, and I make sure it stays that way. The absolute most important are:
- Tabnine
- Github Copilot
- Quokka.js
- env.file support
- Material Theme UI
- Atom Material Icons
- Emmet everywhere
- JSON parser
- Prettier
- Rainbow Brackets
- Vue
- Svelte
- Laravel
- Tinkerwell
- Hugo
