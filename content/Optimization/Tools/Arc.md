I have published two posts on [[Ahoy!]] regarding to it, including a video with my workflow. The best thing about Arc is probably a Command Palette which may be used to access any website and feature of this browser in a second.

The fun part is that you can search a web wherever you are by pressing ⌥⌘N which will open a "Little Arc":

Arc is currently available for users from waitlist or those invited by other users. I have spent all of my invitations on Ahoy (I had more than and I stay in touch with Arc's product team).
