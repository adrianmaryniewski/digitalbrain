# What is Anki?

[Optimization/Tools/Anki]] is an application that facilitates memorization. It is based on the so-called [[Spaced Repetition]], which is repetition at intervals.

## How do I use Anki?
I almost always have the app active either on my phone or computer. Whenever I come across information that I consider worth remembering, I save it as an Anki card.

Every day I flick through a dozen cards for ~20 minutes, thus recalling the suggested cards

I have created a [[Design Maestro]] macro (not available for others) which helps me creating a new cards with a form like one below. It's connected with Anki via AnkiConnect plugin and even supports a [[Markdown]] syntax.
