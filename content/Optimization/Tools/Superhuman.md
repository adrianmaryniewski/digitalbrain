## Czym jest Superhuman? 
Superhuman is a great email client focused on high efficiency through support for keyboard shortcuts and a superbly optimized UI. Its major limitation is that it only connects to gmail or GSuite mailboxes.

**Errors:**
Several times I encountered synchronization errors and even a situation when I lost the draft of a written message. Sometimes there are problems with message formatting and the text customization options themselves are quite limited, which is both an advantage and a disadvantage. And the last disadvantage is that it takes much longer to perform actions on multiple threads simultaneously than it does with gmail.

**Using Superhuman:**.
- I have 5 mailboxes, switched by a shortcut ⌃1-5
- `k` and `j` switches the next and previous message
- ⇧ and up/down arrows highlight messages in the inbox
- a shortcut `gi` takes you to the inbox view
- `/` activates the search engine
- ⇧? enables the list of keyboard shortcuts
- ⌘K Enables the command palette (extremely useful)
- I archive all messages or eventually assign labels to them (action required / awaiting response)
- with an asterisk I mark outstandingly important news
- I use the schedule send option
- I will reply to the rest of the messages immediately
- I write the content of long emails in [[Optimization/Tools/iA Writer]] and then with the help of the [[Projects/Design Maestro]] macro. (available in the premium version) I convert the markdown syntax into styled text and paste it right into the body of the message.
	- this macro will be available in the premium version of Design Maestro
- I use the [[Optimization/Tools/Keyboard Maestro]] macro to create new messages based on the contents of the clipboard
	- this macro is not publicly available
- Superhuman notifications I have disabled, but some messages are forwarded to the Slack channel, which has the right to add notifications to me as long as I am not in DND mode.
- I use Split Inbox (search for a thread, activate ⌘K palette, select split inbox, give name. TIP: you can use formulas in the search, such as whether )
- I additionally filter the newsletters for myself with the help of [[Optimization/Tools/MakeHQ]]
- automation scenarios are not publicly available
- I use superhuman:// to link threads directly (opens the application)
- I use the Superhuman mobile application. As for it, I do not have the slightest reservations
- I work on the basis of inbox 0 and do not write back to all messages if I do not see the need.


Interesting fact: [[Optimization/Tools/Cron]] is a calendar created in the spirit of Superhuman.
