[Optimization/Tools/Hazel]] is an application for automatic file organization. It allows you to define rules for individual folders. According to these rules, it is possible to rename according to certain schemes, move between folders or even run any [[Knowledge/Programming/JavaScript/JavaScript]] scripts. (!)

## In practice
- Organization of files in Downloads (older than one day) into subfolders depending on the type of file
- Organization of files on my Google Drive into subfolders depending on the type of file
- Automatic transfer of recording files for the editor
	- Save to Google Drive
	- Sending 'draftee' information to the editor via [[Optimization/Tools/MakeHQ]] and [[Optimization/Tools/Sendgrid]]
	- Add an entry in [[Optimization/Tools/Airtable]] in the project table (e.g. [[Projects/overment]] / [[Projects/automated]] / [[Projects/eduweb]])
