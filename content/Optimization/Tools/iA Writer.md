title: iA Writer

It's a markdown editor geared toward a minimalist interface and high focus when writing.

## How do I use iA Writer?
In combination with [[Optimization/Tools/Session]] and [[Optimization/Tools/Endel.io]], it is the most important work tool for me, in which I create virtually anything that requires writing a minimum of a few sentences.

iA Writer became a text editor for everything to me. I've created a few [[Keyboard Maestro]] macros ([[Design Maestro]] to be exact), which allows me to transform Markdown to Styled Text and even HTML. There're also integrations with my newsletter, so I can write its content in iA Writer and schedule a campaign in [[Sendgrid]] with a single shortcut.
