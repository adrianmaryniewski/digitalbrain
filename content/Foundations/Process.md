I operate on the basis of a proprietary [[Knowledge/Dictionary/Process]], designed with me in mind. I am constantly questioning, modifying and improving it. It probably **will not work for you**, but you will certainly find plenty of inspiration and resources to help you build your own.

> Everyone is constantly telling you what is good for you. They don't want you to look for your own answers. They want you to believe in theirs. ~ [[Knowledge/People/Dan Millman]]

## Context

It is widely accepted that setting a [[Knowledge/Dictionary/Goal]]s is **essential to achieving results.** Others say it's better to work on a [[Knowledge/Dictionary/Process]] basis.

I myself act on the basis of the [[Knowledge/Dictionary/Goal]] AND [[Knowledge/Dictionary/Process]] (a concept [[Knowledge/Mental models/Genius of The AND]] from [[Knowledge/People/Jim Collins]]).

In practice, I find it difficult to determine the future for more than a week ahead. It's not uncommon for me to have no idea what I'll be doing the next day. At the same time, I have a general outline of where I am going.

### Goals

A well-defined goal [[Knowledge/Dictionary/Goal]] determines the end result and a deadline (\([SMART](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/smart-goals.htm)\)). Combined with the visualization of a realized goal, we form the right attitudes (e.g., enthusiasm -> [[Foundations/Values]]).

For a large target, simply divide it into smaller ones to reduce "resistance" ([[Knowledge/Books/War of Art]]). The realization of smaller goals imparts [[Momentum]] through, among other things, the use of dopamine, about which more is said by [[Knowledge/People/Andrew Huberman#Motywacja Drive]]

**In practice, the goals have drawbacks:** 
- goals build [[Knowledge/Thoughts/Expectations]] that may not match [[Knowledge/Thoughts/Reality]]
- goals build that may not agree with (the result)
- we never know IF we really want it
- we never know what we're really going to get [[Knowledge/People/Dan Millman#Oczekiwania wobec celu]]
- realizing a big goal has an effect **"well, but now what?!"**
- giving up the target or modifying it is not easy (i.e. because of [[Knowledge/Mental models/Commitment Bias]] and/or [[Knowledge/Mental models/Status quo bias]]

Among other reasons, I use targets on a case-by-case basis. Previously, I used a [[OKR]] system. Today I mainly operate on the basis of [[Knowledge/Dictionary/Process]] and [[Knowledge/Dictionary/Direction]]. 

### Direction vs. Goal
- [[Knowledge/Dictionary/Goal]] The goal has an implementation date and conditions for its fulfillment, [[Knowledge/Dictionary/Direction]] does not have them.
- By definition, a direction can be followed but not reached.
- The difference between one and the other has a big narrative role and as [[Knowledge/People/David Goggins]] says, The dialogue we have with ourselves is the most important of all.

### Process
I operate on the basis of a continuously optimized [[Knowledge/Dictionary/Process]] that takes into account: 

* Fundamenty (sleep, diet, sports, being bored)
* Getting to know yourself (journal writing and reading it, StrengthsFinder, MBTI, Principles You).
* Surrounding environment (people I spend time with).
* Development of [[Foundations/Knowledge acquisition system]], learning about [[Knowledge/Mental models/Mental models]] and reading [[Knowledge/Books/Books]]
* Using of a ([[Knowledge/Mental models/Leverage]])) \(my hour generates a multiplying effect\)
* Freedom \(I don't sell my time, avoid planned activities\)

> Discipline equals Freedom ~ [[Knowledge/People/Jocko Willink]]

**In designing my process, I rely on:**

- Curiosity - because it's what leads us to unimaginable places.
- Open-mindedness - also to the fact that I, as well as any other person, simply may be wrong and something that is even widely accepted as truth may have little to do with it.
- In implementing this process, the most important thing for me is to maintain a [[Knowledge/Thoughts/Discipline]] A discipline that Jocko Willink [[Knowledge/People/Jocko Willink]] talks a lot about and [[Knowledge/People/David Goggins]] writes in his book [[Knowledge/Books/Cant Hurt Me]]. 
- In designing the process, I pay attention to [[Knowledge/Mental models/Ergodicity]] and ([[Knowledge/Mental models/Leverage]]) and compound interest ([[Knowledge/Books/The Compound Effect]])
- [[Knowledge/People/Dan Millman]] and his book [[Knowledge/Books/Way of The Peaceful Warrior]] and [[Knowledge/Books/How to Fail at Almost Anything and Still Win Big]] i [[Knowledge/Books/Pound the Stone]] has played a huge role in my attitude towards a process.
- Taking full responsibility for what I do ([[Knowledge/Books/Extreme Ownership]]) and full commitment ([[Knowledge/Books/Skin in the Game]])
- Simply acting ([[Knowledge/Books/Do the Work]], [[Knowledge/Books/War of Art]])
- Letting go ([[Knowledge/Books/Letting Go]], [[The Dip]])
- Constant questioning ([[Knowledge/Books/Think Again]]) and simplifying ([[Knowledge/Books/Simplify]] and [[Knowledge/Books/Insanely Simple]] and [[Knowledge/Books/Effortless]])
- Acting on reality ([[Knowledge/Books/Principles]], [[Knowledge/Books/Deviate]] i [[Knowledge/Books/Getting Real]])
- Allowing mistakes to be made ([[Knowledge/Books/Black Box Thinking]] i [[Knowledge/Books/Think Like a Rocket Scientist]])
- Moving at the edge of your competence
- Continuous learning and staying current
- Acting on habits ([[Knowledge/Books/Atomic Habits]] i [[Knowledge/Books/Deep Work]])
- Leveraging ([[Knowledge/Mental models/Leverage]] i [[Knowledge/Books/The Compound Effect]])
- Long-term action ([[Knowledge/Books/The Infinite Game]], [[Knowledge/Books/Pound the Stone]], [[Knowledge/Books/So Good They Cant Ignore You]] oraz [[Knowledge/Books/How to Fail at Almost Anything and Still Win Big]])
- Acting on intuition ([[Knowledge/Books/Blink]])
- Acting on things that make me stronger([[Knowledge/Books/Antifragile]] i [[Knowledge/Books/Fooled by Randomness]])
- Not giving up ([[Knowledge/Books/Grit]] and [[Knowledge/Books/That Will Never Work]])
- Learning everything, about everything ([[Knowledge/Books/Way of The Peaceful Warrior]], [[Knowledge/Books/Range]] i [[Knowledge/Books/Rebel Ideas]])
- Making smart decisions ([[Knowledge/Books/All I Want to Know is Where Im Going to Die So Ill Never Go There]], [[Knowledge/Books/The Great Mental Models]], [[Knowledge/Books/Seeking Wisdom]], [[Knowledge/Books/Gladiators Pirates and Games of Trust]])
- Understanding myslef (this is the foundation) ([[Knowledge/Books/Understanding the INFJ Personality Type]] and [[StrenghtsFinder 2.0]])
- Questioning authority [[Knowledge/Mental models/Authority bias]] including myself
- Shaping and updating the so-called Models of Reality ([[Knowledge/Books/The Code Of The Extraordinary Mind]])
- Bending reality to my will [[Knowledge/Books/Cant Hurt Me]]

## My [[Knowledge/Dictionary/Process]]

### The foundation
The foundation for me is health (physical and mental) and sleep.

- **Regular sleep**. - [[Knowledge/People/Andrew Huberman#Master Your Sleep]]. I do not use additional aids beside of Ashwagandha. I avoid screens before bedtime.
- **Diet** - Regular seasons of eating vitamin D, K, Omega 3 and magnesium. Once every quarter of 30 days of bee pollen diluted overnight in boiled, cooled water (⚠️ NOTE: bee pollen is a strong allergen).
- **Sport** - [3x a week](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine) + daily stretching with [[Optimization/Tools/Romwod]]
- Breathing exercises with [[Optimization/Tools/Oak]] & tips from [[Knowledge/People/Andrew Huberman#Oddychanie]]
- [[Medytacja]] ~20-30 minutes a day with [[Optimization/Tools/Headspace]], [[Optimization/Tools/Waking Up]] and [[Optimization/Tools/Reveri]]
- [[Knowledge/Thoughts/Boredom]] - a key element in remaining creative
- I practice the ability to focus on the basis of [[Knowledge/Books/Deep Work]] and I often listen to [[Optimization/Tools/Endel.io]]

### Getting to know myself
Getting to know myself is the most important part of my process after the foundations.

- **Keeping a [[Foundations/Journal]]**
- **Personality Tests**. - [[Foundations/Understanding myself#MBTI]], [[Foundations/Understanding myself#StrenghtsFinder]], [[Foundations/Understanding myself#Principles You]], [[Foundations/Understanding myself#The Big Five]]
- **Spending time alone with yourself** - without distractions and the Internet
- **Staying open** - I try to stay open to making mistakes. ([[Knowledge/Books/Think Like a Rocket Scientist]] & [[Knowledge/Books/Black Box Thinking]]) and the fact that I could be wrong.

### Surroundings
I believe that it is impossible to change fundamentally, while our beliefs and habits can change. The biggest influence is not our immediate environment[[Knowledge/Dictionary/Surrounding]] and active ([[Knowledge/Books/Atomic Habits]])

* **Nearest [[Knowledge/Dictionary/Surrounding]]** - I pay attention to who I spend the most time with.
* **Proactivity** - I actively maintain contact with selected individuals.
* **Discovery** - I intentionally reach out to people I feel I want to have contact with.
* **Limitation** - I eliminate meeting and being among people who take away my energy (or I take away theirs). Restrictions also improve the process [[Knowledge/Thoughts/Decision-making]]

> Surround yourself with people who have achieved what you want to achieve and have something in common with them.

### Working style
I often receive questions "How do you embrace it all?". There is no secret to this and it consists of three things:
- I work quite a bit (~8-12 hours a day 6 days a week)
- I maintain as much [[Knowledge/Thoughts/Focus]] as possible 
- I am streamlining the implemented processes by using [[Optimization/Automation/Automation]]

In other words, I do everything to make the best use of my time. For this it is necessary to build a strong [[Foundations/Process#Fundamenty]] As well as space to rest effectively. One of the most important suggestions I received on this topic was as follows: "Adam, if you work hard, you must also rest to the max". I completely agree with this.

The answer is: **the most important information for our brain is an information about another brain."

### Development
Realizing and developing my [[Knowledge/Dictionary/Process]] is a priority for me. I base it almost 100% on English-language sources.

- [[Knowledge/Mental models/Mental models]] - understanding and using them is a superpower, it helps in thinking and decision-making - and I believe that our lives are about them.
- [[Knowledge/Books/Books]] - reading is for me one of the main elements of my development process
- [[Knowledge/Podcasts/Podcast]]
- Specialization and Generalization - I do not have any specialization. I learn everything about everything ([[Knowledge/Books/Range]] & [[T-Shape Leader]])

### Knowledge acquisition system
This is my way of quickly learning new skills and staying current in my circle of skills and knowledge ([[Knowledge/Mental models/Circle of Competence]]).

### [[Knowledge/Mental models/Leverage]]

> Give me a point of support and I will move the earth. ~ Archimedes

The concept of leverage ([[Knowledge/Mental models/Leverage]]) is one of the most important I know. Thanks to her, once done the work gives me results for years.

- My time is not for sale ([[Knowledge/Books/Principles]]) - Since Q2 2020, I have made the decision not to sell my time. For example, I have almost completely reduced consulting and assignments for clients in favor of developing my own products. I only do this in situations where it either makes me happy or gives me benefits beyond financial.  
- I take actions that take advantage of scale and help others for a long time.
- When taking action, I ask myself "How to make 100 out of my one hour?" [[Knowledge/Mental models/Leverage]]
- [[Optimization/Optimization]] - I pay attention to small details. I eliminate them or optimize them (e.g., by simplifying) to the limit (or reasonable).
- [[Optimization/Automation/Automation]] - I automate many areas of my activity. I have an army of robots that work for me day and night.

> The most interesting and important form of leverage is the idea of a product with minimal replication cost. ~ [[Knowledge/People/Naval Ravikant]]

### Finance 
I base my income almost entirely on asymmetrical sources of income: subscriptions, commissions, shares and investments.

Combining this with optimizing my [[Foundations/Process]] with each passing day, the value I generate and my earnings increase disproportionately to my time commitment.
