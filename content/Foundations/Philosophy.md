title: Philosophy

After listening of [this podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOdfrANeJBs) (PL) which where mostly about Ayn Rand (author of [[Knowledge/Books/Atlas Shrugged]]), I came up with an idea to shape up my life's philosophy. What's more, I'll do it right here and share it with others. As of today I don't even know how to start, but in the end...I've already started.
