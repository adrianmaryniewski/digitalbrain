I keep a Journal on [[Optimization/Hardware/iPad]] in an [[Optimization/Tools/Notability]] app. I wrote my first notes in the [[Bear]] app back in 2016. Then I've realised that taking notes by hand is way better because of many reasons. For example I can go back to my notes and see emotions reflected in my writing character.

## Why I keep my Journal?
This is a way for me to "getting the garbage out of your head" (a concept from [[Knowledge/People/Dan Millman]]).

Besides, writing is a way to express my thoughts and emotions. Writing improves one's thinking process, which is something I care about a lot. A similar role is played by [[Knowledge/Mental models/Mental models]]. In a simple words - **by writing I'm learninig how to think.**

In addition to writing, I also read my journal, which gives me a [[Knowledge/Dictionary/Perspective]] (for ex. By looking at yourself and your attitudes from years ago).

## Rules
- Every rule may be broken
- I write practically every day
- I don't have a set time or structure
- I am honest with myself according to [[Knowledge/Thoughts/Radical Transparency]] from a books [[Knowledge/Books/Principles]] and [[Knowledge/Books/That Will Never Work]]
- I do not have a requirement for quantity
- I write what is in my mind at the moment
- Sometimes I write in the third person in order to gain distance from the written words
- I often return to notes written months and years earlier

## Regularity
In my opinion, one of the biggest myths that exist, and at the same time obstacles, to keeping a diary, is the belief and suggestions that it must happen daily.

It was only since I defined the above-mentioned rules that I was able to adjust the diary keeping to my daily rhythm and changing conditions and unforeseen situations. 

Such freedom from artificial rules ([[Knowledge/Books/Letting Go]]), made me able to develop an iron habit of writing a diary (more at [[Knowledge/Books/Atomic Habits]])

## Returning
I know many people who keeps a diary. But none of them have ever told me that they not only write it but also go back to notes from years ago.

I don't do it regularly, but whenever I have more free time. Almost every time is a time of great reflection and an influx of ideas and new energy. 

The most important value from this activity is the new perspective [[Knowledge/Dictionary/Perspective]].
