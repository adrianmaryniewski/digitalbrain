# What is a Direction?

Direction has almost entierly replaced my [[Knowledge/Dictionary/Goal]]s. Instead of trying to predict where I want to go, I just have a clear direction in which I'm heading. This may be equated with a vision or life philosophy, which I wrote more about when I was writing about my [[Foundations/Values]]

With a clearly defined direction, I just have to make sure, that I'm continually optimize my [[Knowledge/Dictionary/Process]] and moving with the same pace (see more at [[Knowledge/Mental models/20 mile march]]).

## Where I'm going to?
I strive to **continuously grow** and **inspire others to grow**. 
I'm doing so in the **most effective way possible**, operating at **maximum available scale** by utilising [[Knowledge/Mental models/Leverage]].

This statement appears in every day in almost every action I take. 
To put this clearly - **this is what my life is all about.**

## How I've defined my Direction?
Actually it was a pretty long process. In a some way I was feeling this all the time, but it wasn't easy to put this in a simple words. Most of the activities I have described here: [[Foundations/Understanding myself]].

## Do I use goals? 
Of course I do. I believe in a some situations that's a good thing to have something you are aiming for. But in the same time I keep in mind, that goals may give me a disillusion, disappointment or even worse. I just try to keep my both eyes on what I'm doing right now, instead of thinking what will happen in the future. I've learned a lot about a proper attitude towards goals from books [[Knowledge/Books/Chop Wood Carry Water]] and [[Knowledge/Books/Way of The Peaceful Warrior]]
