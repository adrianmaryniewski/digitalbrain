title: Values
---

My fundamental values facilitate my decision-making during the [[Foundations/Process]] and moving in the [[Foundations/Direction]] I set out

Each of the following values is equally important to me and unchanging throughout my life.

## My philosophy of life:
**Inspiring others** to grow.

## My values:
- **Quriosity:** I am curious about the World. ([[Knowledge/Thoughts/Curiosity]])
- **Freedom:** Discipline gives me freedom. ([[Knowledge/People/Jocko Willink]])
- **Enthusiasm:** Positive attitude allows me to overcome adversity

## How do I use my values?
When making a daily decision, I return my thoughts to my values by asking "Is this decision in line with them and leading me in the direction I have set?". 

If so, I won't think twice.

This shortens the decision-making process and gives almost certainty that the decision made is the right one. However, our perception of [[Knowledge/Thoughts/Reality]] must still be taken into account and in particular the words of [[Knowledge/People/Ray Dalio]], who said that we are protected from seeing reality by our [[Knowledge/Dictionary/Ego]] and [[Knowledge/Dictionary/Blind Spots]]

## How did I define my values?
I was very helped by the program "[Reign and Own](https://zenjaskiniowca.pl/programy/panuj-i-posiadaj/)" (only in Polish) from Rafa≈Ça Mazura. Guides you through the process of defining your life philosophy and mission ([[Knowledge/Dictionary/Direction]]).

I will not describe the entire process here, due to the fact that it is part of the Rafal Program. I can only recommend its purchase and add that I followed all the steps, according to his suggestions.

## Are the values changing? 
In my case, enthusiasm has been on the list relatively recently. The reason for this was [[Knowledge/Thoughts/Moment of Realization]] that took place when I read the book [[Knowledge/Books/Alamanck of Naval Ravikant]]. One of the quotes of [[Knowledge/People/Naval Ravikant]] said that feeling happy is a matter of our decision.

From that point on, I decided to take it seriously, contrary to what [[Knowledge/Other/The Big Five]] test told me, suggesting that in terms of enthusiasm I am in the 1st percentile (lowest).

At the same time, books such as. [[Knowledge/Books/The Happiness Advantage]], [[Knowledge/Books/Letting Go]] or even [[Knowledge/Books/Think Like a Rocket Scientist]] suggest unequivocally the huge role of enthusiasm in achieving anything.
