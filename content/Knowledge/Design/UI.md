## How do I design the UI?

For UI design, I currently use almost exclusively [[Optimization/Tools/Figma]] in conjunction with the [[Tailwind UI]] component library.

For no-code projects, I use [[Optimization/Tools/Webflow]] in conjunction with the [Systemflow.co] framework(https://systemflow.co).

## Sources of knowledge
On the topic of interface design, I always recommend
- [Refactoring UI](https://www.refactoringui.com/) ~ [[Knowledge/People/Adam Wathan]] (twórca [[Tailwind CSS]]):
- [Learnux.io](https://learnux.io) ~ [[Grzegorz Róg]]
