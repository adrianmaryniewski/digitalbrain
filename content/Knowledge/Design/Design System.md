## Design System 
Currently, I design almost exclusively based on so-called Design Systems, such as [[Tailwind UI]] or [[Systemflow]]. This makes it easy for me to create a clear [[Knowledge/Design/UI]], maintaining consistency, which positively affects the overall [[Knowledge/Design/UX]] of the application.

At the same time, working on the basis of the deisgn system imposes certain limitations that are worth consciously overcoming. Mental models such as [[Knowledge/Mental models/First Principles]], [[Knowledge/Mental models/Inversion]] or [[Knowledge/Mental models/Occams Razor]] and titles such as [[Knowledge/Books/Refactoring UI]] or from the less technical [[Knowledge/Books/Think Like a Rocket Scientist]] are helpful for design.
