title: Absent-mindedness
---

## What is it about?
 It's a state of low attention span and frequent distractions.

## How do I use [[Knowledge/Mental models/Absent-mindedness]]?
In situations where I experience this, I usually go for a walk or just take a break.

I also ask myself if this condition was triggered by something specific. If yes, I address the problem. If not - passively or actively, I wait for it to pass.

Something like this happens to me extremely rarely, and much more often I look for ways to reduce my level of focus, which is usually very high.
