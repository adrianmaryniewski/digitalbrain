## What is it about?
About thinking in terms of the fundamental truths that make up the chosen issue and building solutions based on them.

One of the most current and outstanding examples of the use of first-order thinking is the problem-solving style of [[Knowledge/People/Elon Musk]]. The SpaceX project took spaceflight apart and identified a problem (high costs) and found a solution (reusable rockets).

Certainly, reasoning from the level of first-order principles can lead to extremely different results, especially when combined with more up-to-date knowledge compared to the time in which the existing solution was developed.
