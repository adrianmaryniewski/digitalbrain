## O co chodzi? 
It's the belief that 'new is good or better'.

## How I use [[Knowledge/Mental models/Appeal to Novelty]]?
I try to judge the usefulness of things not by their date of creation or discovery, but by their actual usefulness. For example, I happen to use older programming languages, libraries or tried-and-true tools than to always rely on the latest technologies, which often pass away very quickly.

The general rule of thumb is to look at things with the assumption that since they've been in use for X number of years, if there's no indication to the contrary, you can assume that they're just at the peak of their glory and will stay with us for another X number of years. Currently, this rule reflects reality less and less well, and it's worth taking allowances for the rapidly changing world of technology.
