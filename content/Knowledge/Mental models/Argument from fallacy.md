title: Argument from fallacy
---

## What is it about?
About the assumption that an argument containing a logical fallacy cannot have a true conclusion.

E.g., if someone uses an illogical argument during a discusssion, we assume in advance that everything behind the message is also wrong.

## How I use [[Knowledge/Mental models/Argument from fallacy]]?
In cases where I use an argument that contains a logical fallacy, I try to approach the explanation from the other side. I also often try to understand exactly what my error was and use the solution in explaining the motive behind it.

In the opposite situation, I always try to assume that I **may be the one in the wrong.** This is an attitude familiar from [[Knowledge/Books/Think Like a Rocket Scientist]] and the desire to arrive at the truth strongly emphasized by [[Knowledge/People/Ray Dalio]] in [[Knowledge/Books/Principles]].
