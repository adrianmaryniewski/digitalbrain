title: Automation bias

## What is it about?
Automation bias refers to making mistakes in a highly automated environment where people trust machines more than their own judgment.

## How I apply [[Knowledge/Mental models/Automation bias]]?
As with the [[Knowledge/Mental models/Authority bias]], I do not recognize the authority of the machine. Especially since, as a programmer, I am aware of how easy it is to make mistakes, even when developing software with a high standard of quality.

For this reason, when I am faced with an error, I always verify that the system I am dealing with is designed in the right way.

Interestingly: I also have my decisions double-checked by other people.
