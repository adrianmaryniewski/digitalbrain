title: 20 mile march
---

## What is it about?
[[Knowledge/Mental models/20 mile march]] is a concept from the book [[Knowledge/Books/Great by Choice]] ~ [[Knowledge/People/Jim Collins]]

For a long distance, a smaller but regular pace is better than sprints.

In other words: it's about moving at a steady pace regardless of external and internal factors.

## How do I apply [[Knowledge/Mental models/20 mile march]]?
I care about [[Foundations/Process#Foundations]] and when taking action, I always think long-term with [[Knowledge/Books/The Infinite Game]] in mind.

E.g. I could record 3-4 videos a week for [[Projects/overment]]. In practice I record one but for that I am able to do it regularly (as long as it is [[Knowledge/Dictionary/Priority]] for me).
