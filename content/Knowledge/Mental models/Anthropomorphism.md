## What is it about?
 About attributing intentionality and mental states, characteristic of living creatures, to creatures that are not animate.

## How I use [[Knowledge/Mental models/Anthropomorphism]]
Currently, I can't point to any meaningful examples, other than the fact that awareness of such a trend is readily apparent in the surrounding world. I usually just have a certain distance from it.
