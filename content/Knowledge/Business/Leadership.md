title: Leadership
---

I believe that each of us is or should be a leader for ourselves and others. It has little to do with our position or social standing. Additionally, even the greatest leaders should be willing to follow others when necessary.

I wrote more about being a leader for yourself in one of my articles: [Jakim liderem jeste≈õ...dla samego siebie?](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/jakim-liderem-jeste%C5%9Bdla-samego-siebie-adam-gospodarczyk-/)

I am actively learning leadership every day. People like [[Knowledge/People/Jocko Willink]] and [[Simon Sinek]] and even movies like A Faster Horse and Ocean of Fire have played a big role in this area.
