# Biznes
Creating a company is a way for me to realize all my ideas and it is a way to live according to my [[Foundations/Values]]

Currently, I do almost all my projects with Grzegorz Rog, Piotr Palarz and Mateusz Wierzbicki. I also co-create individual projects with Marcin and Przemek from Przeprogramowani.pl and have a few initiatives of my own, which are an additional form of income or form of expression for me.

## My business history

I have been doing my own projects since I was 11-13 years old. At first it was games and school internet radio.

At the age of 16-18 I did my first projects for clients and at the age of 19/20 I moved to Krakow where I started an internship at a startup where I spent the next 8 years of my life. There in the role of CTO I developed products such as: Notatek.pl, Skillveo and Talent Place.

I have been developing overment since 2017 and eduweb and all other [[Projects/Projects]] since 2020.
