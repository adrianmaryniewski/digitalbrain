# StrengthsFinder
Along with [[Knowledge/Other/MBTI]], [[Knowledge/Other/The Big Five]] and [[UnderstandMyself]], this is the most important tool I used in the [[Foundations/Understanding myself]] process.

## Why StrengthsFinder?
The Gallup Institute has been studying populations for years. One of the questions he asked himself was 'why do some people stand out from the crowd so much?' 

After years of research, they concluded that one of the most important elements is to develop one's strengths, rather than trying to bring weaknesses to a 'normal level'.

The result is StrenghtsFinder, which is designed to help us identify our talents and provide insight into how we can turn them into our strengths.

## Talent vs Strengths
- Talent is a natural fit for us.
- Strengths are talents performed near perfection

In practice, StrengthsFinder helps us identify our Talents, but only by working on them can they become strengths for us.

## How to take the 'Gallup Test'?
I myself used the instructions on a [blog of Dominik Juszczyk](https://dominikjuszczyk.pl/2016/03/jak-zrobic-test-strengthsfinder-po-polsku/). 

I also recommend all of Dominic's work on the subject of the Gallup Test.

⚠️ Note: the test has ~180 questions and you should reserve a minimum of 2 hours to complete it.

## Version 5 or 34?
Initially I did the version discovering 5 talents and later unlocked the other results.

In my opinion, it is a good approach to first properly focus your attention on the TOP5 that are worth working on the most. Only later will unlocking the 34 talents allow you to get an additional, very valuable perspective.

## Re-execute the test
I performed the test again after several years. Some talents remained the same and others completely changed their position.

My overall impression: 'The foundation has remained the same and the things I worked on a lot have changed their meaning.'
