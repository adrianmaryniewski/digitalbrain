# MBTI
This is a popular and free personality test on which I base [[Foundations/Understanding myself]] and [[Foundations/Process]]

Very often I encounter negative opinions about it and examples of undermining its effectiveness. I do not judge it.

Reason enough to take it seriously is that [[Knowledge/People/Ray Dalio]] did the same, using it as one of the most important tools in the recruitment and team-building process. According to him, the test shows certain patterns but its role is primarily to encourage comparison of its result with reality.

**In other words:** the role of the test is to show you some directions and focus your attention on observing yourself and drawing conclusions.

For me, MBTI is one of the most important tools I have come to work with in terms of my development.
