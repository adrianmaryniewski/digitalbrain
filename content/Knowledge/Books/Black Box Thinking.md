[[Antifragility]] (eng. [[Knowledge/Books/Antifragile]]) explains very clearly to us why airplane flights are so safe. One of the main reasons is that every mistake or disaster that occurs contributes to the creation of new [[Policies]] and procedures that minimize their recurrence and strengthen the entire system.

In such a process, the most important thing is to learn from your mistakes and openly admit them.

The problem is that making mistakes is often associated negatively, because from an early age we are taught that it is best not to make them at all - often under threat of punishment.

[[Knowledge/Books/Black Box Thinking]] (as well as [[Knowledge/Books/Think Like a Rocket Scientist]]) presents a very different perspective, according to which making mistakes and learning lessons for the future are essential elements of learning and development.

## Lekcje
- Admit your mistakes - including to yourself.
- Treat your ideas and conclusions as hypotheses - which need to be tested and have the right to fail.
- Treat failure as a lesson. Turn a negative, into a positive.
