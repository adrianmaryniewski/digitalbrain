title: Understanding the INFJ Personality Type
---

A few years ago I heard about the MBTI personality test, while it was only later after taking the 'Gallup' test that I realized how much guidance such tools give us.

In the case of MBTI, it turned out that my profile is the least common of all sixteen (~1-3% of humanity).

While looking for additional materials on each profile, I came across Megan's oft-recommended book, which not only allowed me to thoroughly understand both the pros and cons of the INFJ profile, but also to implement a series of activities that allow me to address and take advantage of them.

Interesting fact: In the chapter ''How to understand INFJs'', the first sentence reads: ''Accept that it is impossible to understand INFJs'' ðŸ˜…

It looks like very evasive ''advice'' but in fact there is a very specific message behind it.

I encourage everyone to look for additional material on personality tests when taking them. At the same time, it is important not to forget that this is only a test representing a very simplified model of personality.
