title: Hard Things About Hard Things

How difficult is running a company? Only those who run a company can find out. We are talking here not only about keeping a cool head during a crisis, but the constant exposure to the fact that 'something may stop working' and the responsibility for this will fall solely on the CEO.

But if crises were the biggest challenge, I guess it wouldn't be so bad. I myself have found many times that in moments when the company is growing, new customers are appearing and everything seems okey, it only takes a moment of inattention to neglect employees, family or oneself.

The need for constant balance was written about a lot by [[Knowledge/People/Jocko Willink]] in his book [[Dichotomy of Leadership]], which I also highly recommend reading.
