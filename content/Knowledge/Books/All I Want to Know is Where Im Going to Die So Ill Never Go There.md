title: All I Want to Know is Where Im Going to Die So Ill Never Go There
---

One of the more interesting form of books I've read. The whole thing takes the form of a dialogue between [[Knowledge/People/Warren Buffet]], [[Knowledge/People/Charlie Munger]], a librarian, and a Seeker.

The latter, upon entering the library, meets the others, who help him find what he is looking for: Wisdom defined as the ability to make good decisions.

This is a book full of practical use of mental models and the principles that guide its characters.

I would only add that this title is far less challenging than the author's earlier book, [[Knowledge/Books/Seeking Wisdom]], which I also highly recommend.
