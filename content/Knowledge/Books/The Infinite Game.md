title: The Infinite Game
---

There are two types of games:
- The kind we play to win
- As well as those in which we play to stay in the game.

These are fundamentally different approaches that we can apply to many areas of life. The former focuses on the usual short-term achievement of results and the latter on a long-term vision.

The former is based on intensity and the latter on consistency (see [[Knowledge/Mental models/20 mile march]]).

In practice, playing the endless game is incomparably more difficult. The reason is that activities aimed at long-term results are important but almost never urgent. This makes it simply easier to undertake activities that will give us an effect in the here and now, rather than ones for which we will have to wait for results.
