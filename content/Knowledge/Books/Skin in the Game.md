title: Skin in the Game
---

[[Knowledge/Books/Skin in the Game]] is a term for risk-informed engagement in pursuit of a set goal.

The book itself phenomenally presents the fact that we can't be 100% sure of anything. It also talks about symmetry and ... asymmetry in topics such as honesty, justice or responsibility, and about the consequences of this asymmetry.

One concept that caught my attention is the ergodic process (eng. [[Knowledge/Mental models/Ergodicity]]), an example of which is flipping a coin 100 times by one person or 1 time by 100 people. The result will be the same in contrast to the Russian roulette game reference.

The conclusion? For some games, the best strategy is not to start the game or to be fully aware of the risks being taken.

It is certainly a book that I will return to regularly.
