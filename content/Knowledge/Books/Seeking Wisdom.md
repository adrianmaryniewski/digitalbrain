Autor: Peter Bevelin

[[Knowledge/Books/Seeking Wisdom]] the absolute best book I've read on the subject of improving thinking and decision-making processes ([[Knowledge/Mental models/Mental models]]).

Despite less than 300 pages, it contains so much knowledge and specifics that it took me 12 months to read it and I will still return to it many times.

The most important lesson: Having an understanding of the concepts and mechanics that guide the world is critically important in every area of life. At the same time, this understanding does not put us above the prevailing rules because we continue to 'play' within the system, but we are able to move more consciously within it.

In addition, [[Knowledge/Books/Seeking Wisdom]] represents the essence from the many books I have read, especially in the areas:
- [[Knowledge/Mental models/Mental models]], 
- Bias (eng. [[Bias]]es),
- Elements of economics, business
- and general principles concerning the functioning of individuals and societies.
