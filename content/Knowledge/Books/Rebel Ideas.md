 Solving an eminently complex problem with an extremely simple solution sounds like a display of genius or luck.

How is it in reality? I don't know. But I can simplify even the most complicated issues and talk about them simply.

This is largely what [[Knowledge/Books/Rebel Ideas]] is about. - a book that emphasizes how important cognitive diversity is in terms of thinking outside the box and going beyond all boundaries.

Such diversity, however, does not come from external features, for example, but from experiences that shape different patterns of thinking.

In creative problem solving, [[Knowledge/Dictionary/Perspective]] and specifically multiple perspectives are key. And this is why cognitive diversity plays such an important role here.

The moment we look at the same problem, in many different ways, we see solutions that, when combined, can be outstanding.

There was only one thing missing from the book for me: cognitive diversity can also be achieved alone. I know this because this is my default style of thinking. But I'll talk about it another time.
