What principles do you follow in life? How do you make decisions and how do you learn from your mistakes?

I encourage you to watch the animation / summary of the book:

[[Knowledge/People/Ray Dalio]] in his book [[Knowledge/Books/Principles]] describes the principles he created throughout his life. He based the development of his company Bridgewater Associates on them, which led him to the list of one of the richest people on earth.

The foundation for building these principles is:
- The difficult art of seeing [[Knowledge/Thoughts/Reality]] as it actually is and not as we would like it to be.
- Even more difficult [[Knowledge/Thoughts/Radical Transparency]] and [[Honesty]].

For example, in his company EVERYONE has access to ALL information except that from the private lives of employees that is not related to the operation of the company.

According to Ray Dalio, achieving any goal boils down to a repeatable process:
1. PRIORITY determinations (not priorities) (more also in [[Knowledge/Mental models/Essentialism]])
2. identifying PROBLEMS and not tolerating them
3. finding their CAUSE
4. development of the PLAN
5. EXECUTION

At the end of the day, the most important thing is not that we apply the principles presented in the book, but that we develop our own that are consistent with us and our [[Knowledge/Dictionary/Goal]]s.
