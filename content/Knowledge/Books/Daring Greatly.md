title: Daring Greatly

This book teaches something important:

**[[Vulnerability]] is the greatest Courage.

At first glance this may sound absurd, because most often vulnerability is equated with weakness. However, when you think about it, it's not an art to 'raise your guard' or 'put on a mask'.

Suddenly it appears that remaining open to everything around us is more difficult than it might seem, and indeed it is a trait of those most courageous.

I would also add that the role played by [[Sensitivity]] is addressed in his books [[Knowledge/People/Dan Millman]], and it is in this book that the sentence from the beginning of this post falls.
