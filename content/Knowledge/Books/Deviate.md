Is what we see [[Knowledge/Thoughts/Reality]]? The answer to this question seems obvious. After all, we can see, we can touch, we can hear, we can taste, and it exists.

However, it turns out that it is still not [[Knowledge/Thoughts/Reality]]. Each of us is able to perceive the same thing completely differently, and it is influenced by so many factors that it is safe to say that it is our reality that is entirely subjective.

For more on this, see [[Knowledge/People/Andrew Huberman]], among others.

Deviate is a book by a prominent neuroscientist who shares the conclusions of years of research. In my opinion, there is still a large filter and margin of error to be placed on what we know about the brain, but the perspective that [[Knowledge/Books/Deviate]] provides is worthwhile. Especially since the conclusions presented in various forms exist in many different sources.
