Are you aware of the existence of a certain force that constantly holds you back?

It's hidden under one of many masks - fear, anxiety, fatigue, excuses, lack of vitality or more important matters - [[Resistance]], whose primary goal is to destroy us and stop us from acting altogether.

[[Steven Pressfield]] in [[Knowledge/Books/The Art of War]] describes what resistance is, what it manifests itself as, and emphasizes the fact that everyone feels it, regardless of place or time. Understanding this fact gives us the advantage of being aware of the problem.

## Lekcje
1. Resistance affects everyone. Regardless of place and time.
2. to pursue your dreams, take them seriously.
3. Accept the fact that resistance never passes. It is an opponent you will face every day. Every day you can lose ... and win.
