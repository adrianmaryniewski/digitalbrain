---

What do mind and body have in common? Everything. We mistakenly treat our mind and body independently, while they are one. It is interesting that [[Knowledge/People/Dan Millman]] presents this by reaching for elements of Buddhism, while [[Knowledge/People/Andrew Huberman]] says exactly THE SAME thing from a scientific point of view.

What can a guidebook for gymnasts teach about life?

Many. In sports, the psyche plays a huge role...as, indeed, in all of our lives.
