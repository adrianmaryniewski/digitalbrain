title: Leaders Eat Last
---

[[Knowledge/Books/Leaders Eat Last]] is a book in which [[Simon Sinek]] presents [[Knowledge/Business/Leadership]] in a view I identify with myself. It is largely based on experiences a from military areas with a focus on special units such as [[Navy Seal's]]. You can read more about this in the books [[Knowledge/People/Jocko Willink]] - [[Knowledge/Books/Extreme Ownership]] and [[Dichotomy of Leadership]].

A quote that remains long in the memory are the words

> - Why would you risk your life for someone you barely know?
> - Because I know he would do the same for me.⠀

These words highlight one of the fundamental elements of leadership and any relationship - it's all about [[Trust]]

[[Responsibility]] is the basis of [[Trust]] and this is the basis of Relationships. Relationships, in turn, provide the sense of belonging that every person subconsciously seeks. ⠀

I recommend [[Knowledge/Books/Leaders Eat Last]] to everyone. At certain times, everyone is a Leader [[Lead]]. And at certain good leader, can follow others.
