title: Getting Real
---

[[Knowledge/Books/Getting Real]] is a book that resonates with me on an unprecedented level, and I can confidently subscribe to almost everything written there.

On the subject of product creation and business development, this is for me the absolute number one of all the books I have read so far.

Getting Real shows a very consistent-to-me approach to project implementation, focused on ACTION, CONSTRUCT and VERIFICATION. This is all based on facts and not an illusion we create due to emotional attachment to our ideas and the work we have done.
