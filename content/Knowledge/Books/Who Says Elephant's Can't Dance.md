title: Who Says Elephant's Can't Dance

[Knowledge/Business/Leadership]] is a topic I have read about in many books. Throughout almost my entire career to date, I have had the opportunity to observe many managers and leaders. Even more than a year, I myself had the opportunity in the role of COO to take on major product development challenges together with my team.

All this taught me a lot and showed me that I still have a lot of work ahead of me, especially since at the end of the day, I was faced with situations where even 'Plan B' failed along with 'Plan A'.

In this book, I had the opportunity to see how the transformation of one of the largest organizations takes place at a time when it was standing on the precipice. And all of this from the best perspective - that of the person who spearheaded the change.

## Lekcje
- Running a company (like all of life) is a game.
- In this game, culture is not one of the elements, but the game itself.
- There are situations in which vision is not necessary and even harms.
- The principles are more important than the process. The process more important than the goal.
- There are no bad teams. There are bad leaders. (This is an acerbic quote from [[Knowledge/Books/Extreme Ownership]])
- Culture creates people's commitment and it is a lever for company growth.
