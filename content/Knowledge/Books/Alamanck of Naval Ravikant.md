## Context
[[Knowledge/Books/Alamanck of Naval Ravikant]] is one of the books where marking valuable passages, ends up blurring the whole. It is a collection and interpretation of statements made by [[Naval Ravikant]]-a well-known Silicon Valley investor who made early investments in companies such as Notion, Twitter and Uber.

Naval places great emphasis in this book on leverage (eng. [[Knowledge/Mental models/Leverage]]) based on the creation of products whose cost of replication is marginal.

In addition to his professional successes, Naval stands out for his special wisdom and the fact that he is simply happy and this does not always go hand in hand with professional success.

## Concepts

### Wealth vs. Money/Status Game
- Wealth ([[Wealth Game]]) is a resource that works for you even when you sleep.
- Money is a way of transforming time and wealth
- Status is your position in the social hierarchy

It is good to live playing the [[Wealth Game]] instead of the [[Status Game]]. In particular, it is useful to understand how to create based on ethics and ignore people who function based on Status Game - they gain it by attacking people who build their wealth.

### [[Specific Knowledge]]
[Specific Knowledge]] is a type of knowledge that cannot be transferred and its automation is not possible. If someone can teach you something, it means they can also teach someone else.

Such knowledge, in my opinion, flows from a combination of natural predispositions ([[Foundations/Understanding myself]]), hard work ([[Knowledge/Dictionary/Process]]), and combining that with the unique qualities of our character.

### [[Knowledge/Mental models/Leverage]]
According to Naval, business leverage comes from Capital, People and Products having low or zero cost of replication (code and media).

## Lessons
- Learn to build and sell: you will become unstoppable
- You will never be worth more than you think. In a business context, set yourself your hourly rate and work as if you actually earn that much
- Independence is more important than how much you earn. It is what gives you space and control.
- When was the last time you were bored? [Knowledge/Thoughts/Boredom]] gives space, space is an element of creativity
- If you can't decide, the answer is NO
- If you are making a decision, choose the option that is more difficult in the short term.
- Happiness is a matter of our decision

And many, many others.
