[[Creativity.inc]] is a book written by the founder of Pixar. The company we all know very well from animated blockbusters.

The most important lesson from the book:
> Failure doesn't always have to be bad as long as you learn from it.

A lesson known from books - [[Knowledge/Books/Black Box Thinking]]

## Lessons
A good idea without a good team is nothing (this was also written about by [[Knowledge/People/Jim Collins]] in [[Knowledge/Books/Good to Great]] and [[Knowledge/People/Jocko Willink]] in [[Knowledge/Books/Extreme Ownership]]).

In a team, everyone should have equal right and opportunity to express their opinion and give feedback to others. This is also what [[Knowledge/People/Jim Collins]] wrote about when discussing the concept of [[Level 5 Leadership]].

## Trivia:
If you are learning to draw, do it upside down and focus on the white space and not the shape being drawn. E.g., when you draw a chair, draw everything that is not a chair. This is how Pixar employees developed their drawing skills.
