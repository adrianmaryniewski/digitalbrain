The world is complicated, and it's hard to deny that. In addition, over the past few decades, technology has accelerated the overall development of almost every area of our lives, bringing about significant changes in the blink of an eye.

In the face of this, the best solution seems to be the 10,000-hour rule for becoming an expert in any field (by the way, about what this looks like in practice, I recommend the book [[The Outliers]]).

In other words: before trying to find ourselves in many areas, we choose one in which we become an Expert.

How about a different approach? Instead of focusing all our attention on a narrow field, we constantly develop knowledge in many different areas in parallel. Well, but since everything is changing so fast, is this even possible?

It turns out that it does, and gives us more options than we might think at first glance.

## Lessons
- Specializing too early is not always a good thing
- The ability to learn quickly and change context provides extraordinary opportunities
- The profession you do today will not be something you do for life.
