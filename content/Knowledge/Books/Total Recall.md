title: Total Recall
---

Without a doubt one of the best biographies I have read so far.

## Lessons
- [[Knowledge/Thoughts/Discipline]] is fundamentally important...
- ...To implement small steps every day.... ([[Knowledge/Books/The Compound Effect]])
- ...that lead us toward a clearly defined vision.... ([[Knowledge/Dictionary/Process]]
- ...to which the road is not easy but our enthusiasm and the right people [[Knowledge/Dictionary/Surrounding]] can help us with it....
- ...until finally we get to a place where people like us are really scarce, or even we are the first to get there.

What more is there to say. This book simply has to be read. I especially recommend the audiobook, which, read by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]s, adds to the experience of the story.
