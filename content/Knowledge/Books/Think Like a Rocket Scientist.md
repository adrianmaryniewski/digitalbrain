[[Knowledge/Books/Think Like a Rocket Scientist]]

Can you think? I guess that's something anyone can do, right?

And don't you sometimes think that others do it better than you? They seem to come up with better solutions faster. Their mind seems to work on completely different principles and access areas that you don't even come close to.

Just why is that if we are all human? Is it about predisposition? Some innate talent that you don't possess?

To be honest, I am not sure about this. However, I can say with great conviction that thinking is a skill that we can learn like any other.

And if we are to learn it from the best - rocket scientists.

## Lekcje
- by sticking to the known, you will not discover the unknown
- we are programmed to fear the unknown
- The simplest solutions are often the best [[Knowledge/Mental models/Occams Razor]].
- ego and [[Knowledge/Dictionary/Blind Spots]] are the biggest barriers against knowing the truth (this is also discussed by [[Knowledge/People/Ray Dalio]] in [[Knowledge/Books/Principles]])
- walk into the unknown but remember to manage risk
- know the mental models (e.g. [[Knowledge/Mental models/First Principles]], [[Knowledge/Mental models/Second Order Thinking]])
- There are things you know that you don't know that you know, things you know that you don't know, and things you don't know that you don't know ([[Knowledge/Mental models/Blindspot Matrix]])
