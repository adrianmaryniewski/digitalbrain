title: Deep Work
---

[[Knowledge/Books/Deep Work]] is one of my most recommended books. I believe that virtually everyone should read it.

We live in a world full of distractions - from notifications to bad habits of reaching for the phone every few minutes. The ability to focus on one thing for an extended period of time is becoming rare. The problem is that ONLY 'deep work' allows us to operate at the limits of our abilities and generate usually unattainable results.

Deep Work ([[Knowledge/Books/Deep Work]]) is: completing one task for a specified period of time with active focus and no distractions.

It is based on principles:
- Effort,
- [[Knowledge/Thoughts/Boredom]], 
- No Social Media and designating time for shallow work (e.g., answering emails).

It is a skill like any other, which needs to be trained to perform better over time. In [[Knowledge/Books/Deep Work]] there is a lot of very practical advice to help us develop it and form the right [[Habit]]s.
