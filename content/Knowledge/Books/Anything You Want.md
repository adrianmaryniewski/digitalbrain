title: Anything You Want
---

[[Knowledge/Books/Anything You Want]] is a book that resonates with me incredibly. It talks about how a big vision, big funding, and a team full of experts are not necessary elements of business growth. All you need to do is focus on taking care of your future customers.  
  
[[Derek Sivers]] shares his lessons and insights from the journey during which he built a company earning more than 0M.  
  
## Lessons
- Never do something just for the money
- Simplify, test, iterate, solve real problems
- You won't know if you want to do something until you do it
- The ability to say no at the right times is a superpower (more in [[Knowledge/Mental models/Essentialism]])
- The ability to withdraw at the right moment is superpower as well (more in the book [[The Dip]])
- Pay attention to the details. They matter most.
- Fulfill your dreams and do what you love. Don't waste your life.
