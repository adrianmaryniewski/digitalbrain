title: Way of The Peaceful Warrior
---

[Knowledge/Books/Way of The Peaceful Warrior]] is one of the most important books for me. Its narrative resonates very much with me and has had a huge impact on me over the years. It is a book that I return to several times a year. It represents for me the absolute #1 in my collection of books.

This is the autobiography of Dan Millman - World Champion in gymnastics, and on the surface it is a simple story of a man who overcame adversity on the way to achieving his goals.

It is worth adding that a great movie 'Peaceful Warrior' was based on this book. If you want to start with something, start with it.
