title: The Mom Test
---

They say that asking our own mother if our idea for a new business is a good one is not very wise.

[[Knowledge/Books/The Mom Test]] says that asking anyone if our idea is a good one misses the point - we won't hear the real answer and it is influenced by many different factors.

In this book, you will find VERY practical advice on how to talk about your ideas and how to interview your customers so that you truly understand their problems and can deliver the most value to them (which they often don't even realize).

## Lekcje
- don't talk about your idea just your customers
- focus on the past and the actual actions that were taken and not on an opinion about the future
- LISTEN!
- if someone tells you about his problem ask: how is he solving it now and what has he done recently to change the current solution?
- The ultimate validation is a purchase and not a promise to buy.
- Verify the 'critical assumptions' that are the foundation of your business. If they are wrong or have become outdated and you don't know it - **then you have a problem.
