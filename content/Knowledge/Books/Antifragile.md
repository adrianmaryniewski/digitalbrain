title: Antifragile
---

If we think of the opposite of fragility, strength or hardness comes to mind.

In reality, however, even if we imagine a super-hard material, there is a good chance that we can find a harder one, use a weak point or leverage, to destroy or permanently damage it.  
  
Now imagine a material that every time you try to damage or destroy it, it becomes stronger than before. Such a feature is [[Antifragility]] (eng. [[Knowledge/Books/Antifragile]])

[Antifragility]] is a powerful concept in the context of building systems, such as a company or our life system. I myself constantly think about this when building my own [[Foundations/Process]]. For this it is necessary to constantly [[Questioning]], [[Making Mistakes]] and learning from them.

Similarly, his system is described by [[Knowledge/People/Ray Dalio]], who bases its construction on the [[Principles]] described in the book [[Knowledge/Books/Principles]].

In the case of [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]], I strongly recommend you still reach for the books [[Knowledge/Books/Black Box Thinking]], [[Black Swan]], [[Knowledge/Books/Fooled by Randomness]] and [[Knowledge/Books/Skin in the Game]] - each contain concepts that drastically improve thinking, with a focus on future events.
