Richard Koch invests in companies according to the 'Star' principle. It says to rank companies according to: market share and the growth rate of the market in which they operate. Those that rank highest are referred to as 'Stars'.

According to Koch, the key here is the title [[Simplification]]: price or value offered.

[[Simplification]] price takes into account its reduction by up to 90% by optimizing the production process (see IKEA)

Simplifying the value offered takes into account creating a product that is simple and pleasant to use (the best UX) (see Apple).

Which simplification is better? It's not a choice, but getting to which simplification MAY work for your business and your capabilities.
