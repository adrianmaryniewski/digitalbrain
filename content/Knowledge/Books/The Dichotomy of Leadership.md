title: The Dichotomy of Leadership
---

Jocko and Leif's first book, [[Knowledge/Books/Extreme Ownership]], presents leadership through the lens of extremes, so [[Knowledge/Books/The Dichotomy of Leadership]] elaborates on the topic by drawing attention to a key element of the whole: BALANCE.

## Lekcje
1. take responsibility and give responsibility to others
2. take care of people and let them go
3. be firm and flexible
4. help push boundaries but don't overwhelm
5. be aggressive but not reckless
6. be disciplined but give freedom
7. hold you accountable but don't constantly look at your hands
8. be humble but not passive
9. look narrow and wide (Zoom in and Zoom Out - Jim Collins)
10. be a leader and learn to follow others

The combination of Extreme Ownership and The Dichotomy of Leadership is the second best leadership lesson I have encountered. The first is reality and practice.
