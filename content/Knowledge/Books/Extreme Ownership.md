title: Extreme Ownership
---

[Knowledge/Books/Extreme Ownership]] is one book I do not recommend reading. I definitely recommend listening to the original audiobook, read by the authors!

[[Knowledge/Books/Extreme Ownership]] is a remarkable lesson in business but not only, as its message can be applied to any area of life. In addition, I highly recommend reading the second part of [[Knowledge/Books/The Dichotomy of Leadership]] right away, which highlights the very important element of [[Knowledge/Business/Leadership]] which is its ambiguity.

The authors are former [[Navy Seal's]] commandos who, after their missions in Iraq, among others, transfer their experiences from the most extreme to a business context.

## Lessons
- [[Knowledge/Thoughts/Discipline]] daje wolność
- Relax, look around, make a call.
- There are no bad teams. There are only bad leaders.
- Let your team work within the set goal and without your involvement in everything.
- Information flow is key - broad context comes from the top and operational details from the bottom
