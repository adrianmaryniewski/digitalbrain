title: Bruce Lee Podcast

A podcast about the philosophy of [[Knowledge/People/Bruce Lee]] hosted by his daughter Shannon Lee. I often return to selected episodes. It's timeless knowledge that can be rediscovered and learned again and again.

## Lessons

### Be Water, My Friend
Adapt to the situation in the best way possible. Especially expressed throughout the quote:

	> Be Water, My Friend. Empty your mind. 
	> Be formless, shapeless, like water.  
	> You put water into a cup, it becomes the cup.  
	> You put water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle.  
	> You put it into a teapot, it becomes the teapot.  
	> Now water can flow or it can crash.  
	> Be water, my friend.

It is clear how important it is to clear one's mind. This is what [[Knowledge/People/Dan Millman]] and his 'Throwing the garbage (out of your head)' talk about. Besides, I associate the comparison to water itself with my constant change of role and near-perfect adaptation to changing conditions. Ultimately 'water can flow, or it can crash' ....


### Hack away the unessentials
In all of this, it is not about daily addition, but subtraction.

It might seem that the key element of development is continuous growth, a constant process of achieving more and better. In practice, I convince myself that it is totally the opposite!

> An _expert_ is one who _knows more and more_ about less and less until he _knows_ absolutely _everything_ about _nothing_.

### Hack away the unessentials
An episode about one of my foundations, which I describe in [[Foundations/Process#Development]] - simplification.
- 'something is perfect not when nothing more can be added, but when nothing can be subtracted' ~ The Little Prince
- 'simplification is not about ignoring some elements, but about getting to the source and consciously rejecting the unnecessary ones' ~ me
