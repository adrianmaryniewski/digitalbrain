[[Knowledge/Podcasts/Huberman Lab]] is a podcast by Dr. [[Knowledge/People/Andrew Huberman]] in whose episodes he addresses a single topic on a daily function or important process for the body, while giving practical tips that can be easily translated into action.

Personally, I base this knowledge on almost all of my [[Foundations/Process#The foundation]] and to keep the right level of focus or low level of focus.

## Lessons

Według Andrew Hubermana jest to tylko po części prawda.
