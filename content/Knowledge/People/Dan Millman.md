# Who is he?
Dan Millman is a World Champion in gymnastics and author of books in which he makes strong references to Buddhist philosophy. His book [[Knowledge/Books/Way of The Peaceful Warrior]] is, for me, the absolute No. 1 of all the [[Knowledge/Books/Books]] I have read.

## What did Dan teach me?

### There are no ordinary moments.
Zawsze coś się dzieje. 

### Peaceful Warrior
A warrior doesn't give up what he loves. He finds love in what he does.

This attitude makes me approach everything I do with love, no matter how difficult it seems.

### Getting to know yourself

***Socrates:**  
Everyone tells you what to do and what's good for you. They don't want you to find your own answers. They want you to believe theirs.  
`
**Dan Millman:**  
And let me guess. You want me to believe yours.  
`
**Socrates:**
No. I want you to stop gathering information from outside yourself and start gathering it from the inside.
`
**Dan Millman:**  
Â :[Dan laughs] What are you, part of some cult or something?`
`
**Socrates:**  
People are afraid of what's inside and that's the only place they're ever gonna find what they need.*


### Rules of life
Humor, Paradox and Change

- Humor: A sense of humor especially toward oneself is a strength beyond measure ([[Foundations/Values#My Values]])
- Paradox: Life is a mystery, don't waste time to unravel it.
- Change: Nothing ever stays the same

### Knowledge vs Wisdom
Knowledge is not the same as wisdom. What you know is not important, what you do is important. Wisdom is using your knowledge.

### Happiness
Be happy here and now, for no reason. Or you will never be.

Something similar was said by [[Knowledge/People/Naval Ravikant]]. Reading this in [[Knowledge/Books/Alamanck of Naval Ravikant]] was a watershed moment for me because of a complete change of attitude towards my life and sense of happiness.

### Expectations of the target
