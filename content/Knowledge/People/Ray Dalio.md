## Rules
Ray Dalio's book [[Knowledge/Books/Principles]] helped me understand the importance of having principles in my life that guide me.

With rules, we improve our decision-making process, which leads us to achieve better results.

Personally, in addition to principles, I also use my [[Foundations/Values]] and [[Knowledge/Mental models/Mental models]]. Working on better decision-making is an important part of my [[Foundations/Process]] for me.

## Radical Transparency
[[Knowledge/Thoughts/Radical Transparency]] is a concept I learned about through [[Knowledge/People/Ray Dalio]]. It is a very controversial principle that I believe is fundamentally important in seeing [[Knowledge/Thoughts/Reality]] as it is, not as we would like to see it ([[Illusion]]).

Personally, I can't say that I am Radically Transparent, while I do my best to be honest first of all with myself, which is not easy, because 'we are the person we are most easily fooled.' ~ Richard P. Feynman.
