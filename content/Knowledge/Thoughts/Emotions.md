title: Emotions

## Context
A few years ago, I learned that my nervous system is slightly more active than most people's. In other words: I feel more. At first I thought it was a defect. Then I realized that it is a source of creativity but at the same time many negative experiences unless I take care of the [[Foundations/Process#The foundation]].

On the subject of emotions, I recommend the episode of [[Knowledge/Podcasts/Huberman Lab#Emocje]] and a book [[Knowledge/Books/Daring Greatly]]

Currently, emotions are a powerful source of energy for me, due to the 'Alchemy of the Body' process that [[Knowledge/People/Dan Millman]] wrote about in his books.
