title: Intuition
---

## What is it about?
According to [[Foundations/Understanding myself#MBTI]], my profile is INFJ. Other personality tests confirm a very high use of intuition. For as long as I can remember, it has been difficult for me to **disagree with this.

## What is intuition to me?
One of the best terms I've come across is **unconscious intelligence**. For me, it's something just on that level. What's more, I believe that intuition **never gets it wrong** and the only reason for situations where we say that 'intuition has failed us' is because we haven't learned to listen to it.

I use intuition every step of the way, especially for decisions where I lack the information to act logically. Not infrequently, even when logic suggests a solution and intuition another, I prefer to take the second path.
