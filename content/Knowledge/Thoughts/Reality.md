## Context
Many sources (e.g. [[Knowledge/Books/Deviate]]) indicate that we do not have the ability to perceive reality as it is and each of us sees it differently. It's hard to say if this is actually the case, but according to my current understanding, it may be close to the truth.

**This is due to a simple fact.
- There is a lot going on around us but our senses, receive some of the information
- the information received by the senses is filtered by perception (what we currently focus our attention on)
- Ultimately, the handful of data received is filtered, and worse, interpreted by our beliefs, biases, and subjected to many thought traps.

There are many indications that if our brain has a variety of data at its disposal, it will focus primarily on **information about the other person.** This is why our immediate [[Foundations/Process#Surrounding]] is so important, as discussed by [[Knowledge/People/Kapil Gupta]], among others.

## Action
Two things protect us from seeing reality according to [[Knowledge/People/Ray Dalio]]:
- Our [[Knowledge/Dictionary/Ego]], which always wants to be right
- Knowledge/Mental models/Blind Spot Bias]], or things we don't know about and things we don't know we don't know ([[Knowledge/Mental models/Blindspot Matrix]]).

In discovering things we don't know about, we are most likely to be helped by other people and an attitude of [[Knowledge/Thoughts/Radical Transparency]]. In combination, the two give us the ability to see a different [[Knowledge/Dictionary/Perspective]].

You can learn more about the action described in [[Knowledge/Books/Principles]]

## Models of reality
Just as [[Knowledge/Mental models/Mental models]], there are [[Knowledge/Mental models/Modele Rzeczywisto≈õci]] which I learned about in [[Knowledge/Books/The Code Of The Extraordinary Mind]]. 

As described above, we cannot see reality as it is because its perception is distorted by various factors. By creating and modifying models of reality, we are able to shape our interpretation and thus influence how we see the world.
