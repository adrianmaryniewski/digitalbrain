## No expectations
I live without expectations, being prepared for anything. I execute my [[Knowledge/Dictionary/Process]] to the best of my ability, and because of this I have the conviction that every day I am doing something that develops me.

Some time ago, I noticed that having expectations that are too high (or too low) causes a lot of worry and stress and distracts me from what I have.

## Emotional attachment
Ultimately, lack of expectations does not mean, for example, not setting indicators by which I judge whether a project is successful or not. The difference, however, is that I am intentional about not getting emotionally attached to my ideas and projects.

Nor does it mean living without emotions, which in my view [[Knowledge/Thoughts/Emotions]] play a huge role and our job is not to control them, but for them not to control us.
