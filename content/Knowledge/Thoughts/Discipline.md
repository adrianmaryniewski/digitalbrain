## What is it about?
Discipline falls very often in the context of successful implementation of [[Knowledge/Dictionary/Goal]]s. In practice, I am closer to the point of view of [[Knowledge/People/Jocko Willink]], who said that 'Discipline gives freedom' and emphasized it very clearly in his book [[Knowledge/Books/Extreme Ownership]]. Looking at discipline from this perspective and combining the knowledge of habit formation with [[Knowledge/Books/Books]] [[Knowledge/Books/Atomic Habits]] gave me a great tool to implement [[Knowledge/Dictionary/Process]].

## How do I use Discipline?
In my opinion, one of the biggest obstacles to discipline and thus [[Freedom]] is none other than the [[Resistance]] described by [[Steven Pressfield]].

I wrote about how I deal with it in an interview on the blog [Skutecznie efektywny](https://skutecznieefektywny.pl/automatyzacja-adam-overment-gospodarczyk/)

Besides, discipline to me is nothing more than proper [[Habit]] and living with the knowledge that every moment we are developing a habit. The question is, is it a good one?
