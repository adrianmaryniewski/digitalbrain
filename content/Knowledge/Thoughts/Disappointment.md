Disenchantment or more Roz-Enchantment literally means release from enchantment, that is, breaking out of the illusion.

In other words, the moment of disillusionment is the moment when we see [[Knowledge/Thoughts/Reality]] as it is and not as we think it is.

The above concept was introduced to me by [[Knowledge/People/Dan Millman]] in his book [[Knowledge/Books/Way of The Peaceful Warrior]].
