## What is Curiosity to me?
Curiosity overcomes all limitations and leads to unimaginable places. It is the absolute foundation of my functioning.

To many people, productivity seems to require mastering amazing work techniques and using amazing tools. Despite all my enthusiasm for both of these things, I believe they are merely an add-on. Especially when we find that most of our energy is burned out by our worries, fears, fighting the aforementioned resistance or trying to realize exorbitant expectations. The list is very long.

Curiosity makes all these things cease to have any meaning and almost 100% of your energy begins to focus on action.

Curiosity frees us from fear, makes us overlook fear, because we have nothing to fear. And since there is no fear, there is also no resistance. Instead, there is pure exploration, discovery and fun. Then even making mistakes is fully what it should be: a lesson and a pointer to correct course on the way to the goal.

Ultimately, curiosity yields something else that I value most: questioning what is.

But not questioning in an arrogant way with the belief that we are the ones who are right. It's questioning in an effort to discover the truth. It's assuming that we might be wrong. Curiosity allows you to change even your fundamental beliefs, and this, in my opinion, is essential in the development process. Especially since even what is right today ceases to be so tomorrow, because we do not live in isolation. Everything around us is changing.

Curiosity is everything to me.
