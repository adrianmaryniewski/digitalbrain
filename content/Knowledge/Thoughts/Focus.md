## What is Focus for me?
I see the ability to focus as one of the most important skills we can develop in ourselves. Especially considering how much energy we waste every day on totally irrelevant things and how many distractions are around us.

## Sense of happiness
Feeling [[Knowledge/Thoughts/Happiness]] is very helpful in managing [[Knowledge/Thoughts/Energy]] and achieving [[Calmness]].

On this topic, I probably learned the most from [[Knowledge/People/Dan Millman]] and [[Knowledge/People/Naval Ravikant]].

**Socrates:**  
There's a lot you'd have to know before you could understand what you saw.
**Dan Millman:**  
Go. Ask me. Ask me something. Captain.
**Socrates:**  
Are you happy? You said I could ask you anything.
**Dan Millman:**  
What does happy have to do with anything?
**Socrates:**  
Everything.

It is difficult to function and even more so to concentrate in moments when our [[Mind]] is full of unnecessary thoughts that generate negative [[Knowledge/Thoughts/Emotions]] that take us away from [[Knowledge/Thoughts/Energy]].

## Work organization
Not without reason [[Optimization/Hardware/Hardware]] which I use for work and [[Optimization/Tools/Tools]] play such an important role in my functioning and certainly contribute to my overall overall effectiveness.

In addition to just having the right equipment and tool configuration, the way I use them is also important.
- I limited my use of [[Optimization/Hardware/iPhone]] to 15-25 mins per day
- I turned off almost all notifications
- I created my own [[Optimization/Automation/Scenarios#Useful notifications]] system with the help of [[Optimization/Tools/Keyboard Maestro]].
- There is nothing on my desk except the screen, keyboard, trackpad and possibly one cup.
- My phone usually lies out of arm's reach
- I measure my work with the help of the [[Optimization/Tools/Rize]] application.
- I take breaks every 45 minutes or so
- I work using the pomodoro technique with the [[Optimization/Tools/Session]] application.
- I set the break time with the help of [[Siri]] on [[Optimization/Hardware/Apple Watch]].
