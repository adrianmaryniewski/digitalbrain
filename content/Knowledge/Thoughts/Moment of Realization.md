## What is the Moment of Realization?
This is the moment when knowledge turns into action. That is, **it's not what you know that matters, but what you do with it.** Many things we know and don't do. The moment of realization/understanding, on the other hand, is the beginning of action.

Moreover, this is one of the main reasons why I read [[Knowledge/Books/Books]], including those that seemingly teach me nothing new. Reading them creates the space to **understand what I have known for a long time.
