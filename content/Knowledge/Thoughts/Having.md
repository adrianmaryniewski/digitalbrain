## "I already have everything!"
Getting to the point when I can say 'I already have everything' is fine in one case only: **when it doesn't depend on what I actually have.

This may sound a bit illogical, since the sentence itself, after all, refers to possession.

I simply believe that the fulfillment resulting from possession is good but as an inner conviction that we come to as a result of finding 'something' within ourselves. In each case this 'something' may be different, but it is always characterized by something important: **there is no way to take it away from us**.

In theory, it's a bit philosophical, but it's actually very practical. The idea is that the state we are in when we 'have it all' is characterized by a sense of inner [[Tranquility]] and [[Knowledge/Thoughts/Happiness]]. Both of these things are the source of infinite [[Knowledge/Thoughts/Energy]].

And now if this state can be taken away from us, because its source is in the things that surround us, then there is a rather good chance that it will be temporary. And I don't even mean extreme things here, such as losing something we have, but even getting used to it. As a result, simply the said condition passes.

In addition, even everything can remain the same but a new dream, idea or goal that we want to achieve pops into our heads. And then again 'we don't have everything' and the condition passes again.

As a result, the very feelings of fulfillment, realization or having it all, are fine because they give the mentioned peace and happiness. And the moment we 'detach' these feelings from things beyond our control, we simply become 'more stable in the foundations' and harder to shake us up (harder doesn't mean impossible) and we can even become stronger by using [[Anti-brittle]].
