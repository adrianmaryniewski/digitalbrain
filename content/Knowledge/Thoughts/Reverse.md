At every turn, I notice how big a role reversal (eng. [[Knowledge/Mental models/Inversion]]) plays, and the longer I use it, the more I understand why people like [[Knowledge/People/Warren Buffet]] value it so much.

## The world stands on its head
One gets the impression that many things in the world are literally reversed.
For example:
- Productivity has a lot to do with boredom and relaxation
- Happiness is a matter of decision and a state of being rather than a state to strive for
- often the obstacle to getting something is the desire to have it
- Fully enjoying what we have requires that we accept that we may lose it

## I act 'in reverse'
Very often my example shows how effective it is to reverse and even act totally opposite to most or our natural reactions.

## Intentional reversal
Currently, when making decisions intentionally, I think about the results I can achieve if I behave exactly the opposite. Likewise, when solving problems, I consciously reverse my assumptions to be able to see a different [[Knowledge/Dictionary/Perspective]] and thus often hit upon a solution that is not apparent at first glance.
