## What is it about?
[Knowledge/Thoughts/Emotions]] play an important role in our lives and, in my opinion, serve us as long as we don't let them take full control. Naturally, there is no 'switch' anywhere that decides this, and frankly, a very good thing, because disconnecting from emotions is not a good idea.

If we care a lot about something, we generate attachment in ourselves, the consequence of which can be pressure, anxiety and various negative emotions that take away our energy and can even poison us and make us unhappy. That's why sometimes it seems that 'the harder we try, the harder it is to achieve something'. I am very often accompanied by a feeling of 'blockedness', related to this very thing. Being aware of this, I often manage to overcome it.

All of this also has a very negative impact on the [[Knowledge/Thoughts/Decision-making]] process, because it is difficult to approach [[Knowledge/Thoughts/Reality]] while there are a lot of negative emotions inside us. In such situations, it is most helpful to change [[Knowledge/Dictionary/Perspective]], which not infrequently requires us ... that we wait. And it is difficult to wait without letting go of what seems to be everything at the moment.

Very often when I play [[Gran Turismo]] racing against the clock, I experience that I crank out my best laps at a time when I feel a little relaxed and **further care**, but the pressure tension is gone. You could say it's a kind of balance or more like 'dancing on the edge' of pressure and relaxation. It's important to find your place between **relaxation** and **pressure**.

> Take out the trash. The trash is anything that's keeping you from the only thing that matters, this moment.  Here.  Now.  And when you truly are in the here and now, you'll be amazed at what you can do, and how well you can do it. ~ Dan Millman

One of the most important and at the same time the most difficult to execute (and even to understand itself) is the concept of letting go of 'what we care about most'. Whenever I even think about it, it seems absurd, e.g. how can we be ready to, for example, lose a job we like? Will we stop seeing people we love to spend time with? Will our loved ones leave? How can we even think that this is ok?

I realized that this may be the case the moment I changed my attitude after reading [[Knowledge/Books/Letting Go]]. What's more, it is **necessary** to enjoy what we have, without any limitations and more than ever! A simple example: you visit your parents and see them growing older with each visit. You are aware that this reunion, this Christmas, this family party, may be the last. What then? Do you rejoice or the opposite?

> It's not magic, Tommy.  Just getting rid of all that bullshit you have up in your head that tells you you might not be enough.  So when you get up there, you make every move about the move.  All right?  Not about the gold.  Not about what your dad thinks about you. Not about anything but that one moment in time.

On the other hand, it can be said that it is enough not to think about it, and in part this can be a good solution. But can we then consciously enjoy every moment? In my opinion, no, but I understood this the moment I said goodbye to one of my loved ones and felt peace combined with a bit of joy. And this, in my opinion, was possible just by letting go.

The last thing to understand is the difference between **letting go** and **resignation**. Letting go is when we move beyond the negative emotions associated with, for example. **possibility of failure**, **fear of success**, **possibility of making a mistake** but we still do our thing with full [[Enthusiasm]]s and a sense of happiness. In my opinion, it is this state that makes us able to find the energy to overcome adversity.

## What is letting go for me?
For me, letting go is a skill that can be developed and a state to be in. It is largely what allows me to carry out my [[Projects/Projects]] and enjoy every moment spent with other people.

Personally, I experience letting go as a **space** that is created around me in my imagination. It is the moment when I am able to see all the negative [[Knowledge/Thoughts/Emotions]] that are trying to get to me and the thoughts that are trying to distract me. It seems to me that a very important part of forming this skill was the whole [[Foundations/Understanding myself]] and [[Mindfulness]] process. In contrast, the most groundbreaking event was reading [[Knowledge/Books/Letting Go]].

I think it is very important that letting go does not mean that we no longer care. On the contrary. I have a belief that by letting go we show how much we care, by trying to overcome negative emotions and getting rid of selfish motivations to be fully here and now. Because [[Knowledge/People/Dan Millman#Nie ma zwykłych chwil]].
