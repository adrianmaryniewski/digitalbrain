## What is an API?
Do you know what an **interface** is? It is a **interface** that **enables you to communicate**. E.g. a keyboard is an interface that allows you to communicate with your computer. Buttons in an application are also an interface (in this case a graphical one - User Interface / UI).

API, on the other hand, is Application Programming Interface, translated, application programming interface. In more human terms: **a programmatic means of communication used in applications.

Simply put, applications somehow need to send information either **within themselves** or **to communicate with other applications.** Depending on the need, we can talk about a closed API (used only inside the application or company) or an open API (made available to the public, not necessarily free of charge).

Currently, thanks to tools such as [[Optimization/Tools/MakeHQ]] and [[Optimization/Tools/Zapier]], using the API has become easier for more than just those who can program.
