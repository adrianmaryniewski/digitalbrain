title: Perspective

Perspective is one of the most important tools I use (right next to [[Knowledge/Thoughts/Intuition]]). Being able to adjust it is extremely important to me because of my current beliefs about [[Knowledge/Thoughts/Reality]].

One approach says that [[Truth]] is made up of several perspectives:

And this is an approach that I think is very accurate. But at the same time, if we look at the picture:

It can actually be admitted that looking from a given perspective, reality is different for us than it is for someone with a different perspective and different from reality itself.

At the same time, actually bringing together several perspectives, seems to draw a picture of the whole.
