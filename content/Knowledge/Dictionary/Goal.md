Goals are recognized as essential elements for achieving great results.

Personally, I gave up on designating them at the beginning of 2019, when, doing a recap of the previous year, I asked myself '**Can it be done differently?

Then I came across books such as [[Knowledge/Books/So Good They Cant Ignore You]], [[Knowledge/Books/The Compound Effect]] and [[Knowledge/Books/How to Fail at Almost Anything and Still Win Big]], which reinforced my belief that setting goals is not the only way.

What's more, I now believe that goal setting simply didn't work well in my case (which doesn't mean that it does in others as well).

I currently operate solely on [[Foundations/Process]] and [[Foundations/Values]]
